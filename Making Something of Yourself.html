 * Prepend your passage names with a single-word group identifier.
 * 
 * For example, start all of your side-menu passages with "StoryMenu", ie 
 * "StoryMenu Appearance", "StoryMenu Characters", etc.
 * 
 * Then instead of using <<return "Continue">> or somesuch, use 
 * <<multireturn "Continue">> instead.  When you click the link, it will search

It&#39;s not even the good beer. You can&#39;t afford the //good// beer.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Thirty years old. Stuck at the same stupid job. Working in a TV and electronics store. Sales, and not very good at it. And nowhere to go from here.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Your parents keep wondering if you&#39;re going to move back in with them. You can see it in their eyes. They never ask, but you can always tell, the way they ask about your apartment. How things are going. If you&#39;ve started thinking about buying a house of your own yet.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;They&#39;re probably disappointed in you. Hell, //you&#39;re// disappointed in you. Even your friends don&#39;t want to be around you much.&lt;/div&gt;
— [[proceed|Start3]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="6" name="Start3" tags="" position="350,425" size="100,100">&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Justin Mayer, your best friend from school, is a doctor. Specialized in OB/GYN. He&#39;s rolling in the bucks. Got a wife. Two kids. You guys used to play together outside during recess in the third grade, on that metal thing that looked vaguely like a rocket ship. You used to tell each other you were going to be astronauts. Justin went up, or at least his career did. Yours, not so much.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Your beer arrives. The bartender collects your empties and leaves you with nothing. Typical.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You had a friend named Curt Hudson. Nice guy. Black kid, used to be your study partner for projects and group assignments in C Block in junior high. Justin was in B Block, so you&#39;d made new friends. Curt and that other kid, what was his name? Russell Chao, the kid with the computer.

Both married. Curt&#39;s wife is gorgeous. Even Russell&#39;s isn&#39;t half-bad looking.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Why didn&#39;t you make anything of yourself, like they did? God knows. Not you.&lt;/div&gt;
— [[proceed|Start4]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="7" name="Start4" tags="" position="350,275" size="100,100">&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Thirty years old. No wife, no girlfriend.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;[img[28male.png]]&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Another look in the mirror. Are you so fundamentally unloveable? Are you broken? Unambitious, rudderless? Without direction or purpose in life? Perhaps that&#39;s it. You&#39;re just coasting along, drifting through the days. No point to anything, no drive to change, just you and the empty apartment and the bar down the street. Just you with the empty life and the empty bottles that pile up behind the bar.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;There&#39;s nobody nearby at the bar to talk to, but you can&#39;t help but mutter under your breath. &quot;I wish I could go back and . . .&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You don&#39;t really know how to finish the thought, so you leave it hanging there in the air.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Do you?&quot; a low female voice says, and a wine glass slides onto the bar beside you. A woman in a black dress slips onto the neighboring bar stool, the dress pulling up to show a little more thigh as she eases those tawny legs onto and across the leather stool. Her eyes are pale and direct, almost colorless. Her hair — funny, but you can&#39;t remember what color it was either. It was . . . probably long? long enough to touch her shoulders? But it might also have been elfin-short, showing the shape of her head framing those haunting, colorless eyes.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Actually, the black dress is about the only thing you could really be sure of. It was almost like the woman wasn&#39;t even there, except that the dress gave her a sort of shape in the air.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Do you wish you could make changes in your life?&quot; she asks, swirling the glass of wine on the counter. &quot;Lots of people do. All you have to do is ask. Speak the thought aloud.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
— &quot;[[I want to change my life.|Start5]]&quot;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="8" name="Start5" tags="" position="350,125" size="100,100">&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Of course you do,&quot; she murmurs, and you find that you can&#39;t quite track the movement of her lips as she speaks. It&#39;s like her mouth isn&#39;t moving. But it has to be, because you can hear her. Just trying to follow her words and make eye contact makes you feel a little dizzy and lost. Perhaps it&#39;s all the beer.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Of course you want to change your life,&quot; she says sympathetically, turning around to put her elbows on the bar. &quot;You&#39;ve done nothing with it, and gone nowhere. You have no guiding star. You have pushed away all the people who could have guided you.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;You could have chosen the path of strength and become an athlete,&quot; she goes on, and there is a wisp of disappointment in her voice. &quot;You could have chosen the path of wisdom, and become a scholar. You could have chosen the path of society, and become famous and well-liked. There was also the middle path, the path of balance. But you chose no path at all, and now you are trapped in the void between them with no achievements to your name.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;She seems to look at you, or through you, with that invisible all-seeing look of hers. &quot;What do //you// do, Alexander? You sell. Televisions, is it? A device made by the skilled, used for watching the talented. You are neither. You do nothing, and make nothing. You are a middle man. You sell the things that others make and do.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Your eyes are playing tricks on you. The woman, floating in the black dress, seems like the only real thing in the world. The bar seems to be hanging in the background like smoke. One stiff breeze and it might blow away.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;But you can go back and change things,&quot; she assures you, as the smoky background begins to billow into puffs of darkness. The bar stool beneath you feels as if it isn&#39;t even there, and you&#39;re standing on . . . something. &quot;You can go back and change the things that must be changed, and make something new of yourself. But to do that, you&#39;ll need a guiding star. A new light, by which you can choose a path. And there,&quot; she said, and her voice sounded as if her invisible face were smiling, &quot;is where I can help.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

You close them again, and try to squint to see.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;There&#39;s a bright green carpet of leaves . . . above you? In front of you? Sunlight is streaming down, scattering through the rustling canopy of overhanging branches. Birds are twittering. Somewhere nearby there&#39;s the sound of a babbling brook, and the smell of dank moss surrounds everything. You&#39;re lying on your back on some damp ground, with branches and fir cones poking into your skin. And a huge familiar shadow is leaning over you.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;The shadow comes into focus against the bright light. It&#39;s your mother — your mother, twenty years younger. Your mother, before she stopped wearing dresses, before she got that Mom Haircut back when you were in the 8th grade. You haven&#39;t seen her like this since . . . well, since grade school. Her face is a mask of concern, mixed with anger and relief.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;She hasn&#39;t looked like this in //years.// Decades, even. What is going on?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Is this what the mysterious woman meant by making changes in my life? Did I . . . did I //really// go back in time?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Mom, I&#39;m okay,&quot; you say, hearing your tiny, youthful little voice, as she tests your arms and legs gingerly with those long, tender fingers of hers. &quot;I&#39;m fine.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;You&#39;re not //fine,// sweetie,&quot; Mom says sternly. &quot;You fell out of a tree. I told you that you shouldn&#39;t keep climbing these trees down by the brook. They&#39;re mossy and they&#39;re very slippery, and you&#39;re //very lucky// that you didn&#39;t break any bones falling out of it.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Oh. //This// was the day you fell out of a tree in the back lot, the big empty unsold acreage behind your parents&#39; house. It was all woods and creek and wet ground, perfect for finding frogs and playing war and building forts out of fallen branches and hiding among the trees. This was before the property was all divided up to make a new housing development. But //that// day had been twenty years ago.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;[img[09male.png]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;It seems that that day is //today.// You&#39;re nine years old, and you&#39;re wearing your favorite old checkered blue and green shirt and a pair of children&#39;s denim jeans.

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;A weary look passes over your mother&#39;s face. &quot;I know, sweetie. I know you like to pretend you&#39;re a boy, but you&#39;re really not. Boys are different.

We&#39;ve let you play make believe, and I think your father and I have been really patient with you about this, but I think it&#39;s time we put away that little game and start acting like a good young lady, don&#39;t you?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You gape open-mouthed at your mother. &quot;But Mom--&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I&#39;m a girl?&quot; you ask, looking down at your checked shirt and your dirty blue jeans.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;A weary look passes over your mother&#39;s face. &quot;Yes, sweetie. I know you don&#39;t like to act like a girl, but you really are a girl and not a boy. Boys are different. Boys are bigger and stronger. Your father and I have let you make believe you were a boy, and I think we&#39;ve been really patient with you about it, but I think it&#39;s time we put away that little game and start acting like a good young lady, don&#39;t you?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

We&#39;re going to have to scrub you clean.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Then she takes your little hand, and stands up. Mom towers over you, and she&#39;s very strong as she drags you up through the trees toward the back of the house. You have no choice but to follow.&lt;/div&gt;

It is exactly as you remember it: dated wallpaper, &lt;&lt;if $year lt 1970&gt;&gt;burnt-orange carpets, exposed stone surfaces.

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You try to remember what your apartment looked like back in the . . . the . . . place where you came from. The future? You squint your eyes shut, trying to visualize your old apartment, scrubbing moss stains and tree sap out of your palms by feel. You can&#39;t imagine what it looked like. It was . . . big. And it was yours. But you can&#39;t see it.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;When your hands are clean, you inspect them. They&#39;re tiny, dainty little hands. They&#39;re petite and childlike. And they&#39;re fairly clean. Are these girls&#39; hands? Are you really a girl?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Some murmuring outside the bathroom door catches your ear. Your parents are talking about something.&lt;/div&gt;

There is the clatter of a casserole dish in the kitchen, and the sound of a cupboard door opening. &quot;Did you buy mushroom soup? Oh, here it is. I mean, she insists that she&#39;s a boy, and I don&#39;t know what to do about it.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;It&#39;s a phase,&quot; your father&#39;s voice says. &quot;Remember that child psychologist, what&#39;s his name--&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;The one with the mustache? Maxwell.&quot; More rattling in the kitchen.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;He said Alex is just going through a tomboy phase. When she hits puberty and starts to notice boys, it&#39;ll all just fall away.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Your mother curses under her breath at something, and you can&#39;t help but giggle a little at the naughty word. &quot;Greg, help me with these soup cans. We really need a new can opener. I&#39;ll start the pasta noodles.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I&#39;ll get it.&quot; There is the sound of a chair being pushed back across the hardwood maple floors, and your father&#39;s footsteps leading onto the lineoleum.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I just don&#39;t know if we can wait that long,&quot; your mother says. &quot;She&#39;s still only nine. Remember what you and I talked about before, about sending--&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;The grind of the electric can opener interrupts whatever your mother was about to say, and your father&#39;s answer. The sickly growl of the old appliance drowns out both voices, jangling all sounds together in an unintelligible blur. Then you can recognize your father speaking, saying &quot;--lot of money, Cheryl. Are you sure it&#39;s worth it?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I want what&#39;s best for my little girl,&quot; your mother says with finality. &quot;Are you done? Hand me those cans.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
— [[come out of the bathroom|Tomboy Meet Parents]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="17" name="Tomboy Meet Parents" tags="" position="650,800" size="100,100">&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You emerge from the bathroom with clean, wet hands and go into the dining room. It is exactly as you remember it from your childhood: your grandmother&#39;s dish sets tucked away in the wooden cupboard your grandfather built, the jungle of houseplants hanging from hooks in every corner and occupying every free shelf. Antique plates on the walls. A family photo, with you in between your parents, a defiant little look on your face. Dressed as a boy.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Show me your hands, princess,&quot; your father says, amused, and you display your palms for inspection. You&#39;re not sure what to make of being called //princess.// You feel a little resentful, like you ought to object to it, but you doubt it would be taken well by either of them. &quot;Very good,&quot; he says, looking over your hands. &quot;Now sit down for dinner.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Not in //that// shirt,&quot; your mother insists. &quot;Alex, go change. Throw that dirty shirt in the laundry pile and put on something else. The back is all //covered// in mud and leaves.&quot; She exchanges a significant look with your father, as if she is willing him to remain silent until you&#39;re out of the room.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You climb up the stairs, trying to refresh your memory of the layout of that long-ago family home. Your bedroom was on the right, upstairs, past the guest bathroom, wasn&#39;t it? Yes, this must be it.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;&lt;display &quot;Childhood References&quot;&gt;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Your bedroom looks . . . familiar. Not exactly as you remember it, but not totally alien, either. A bed, unmade, with sunny yellow sheets lumped up to one side, and an optimistically pink duvet draped over the footboard. A desk for doing homework, covered with crayons and colored pencils. A shag area rug in the center of the floor with the image of a cowboy on horseback designed into the weave. A baseball poster. A crude, childish drawing of a giant robot.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;But it isn&#39;t completely masculine. There&#39;s no sign of your model airplanes, the Revells and the Snap-Tites that once hung from the ceiling. $toy_choice that had once lined the windowsill had been replaced by a couple of plastic horses. You can&#39;t see any sign of the glow-in-the-dark stars that had once showed the layout of the Big Dipper on the ceiling. It&#39;s . . . boyish, but not completely. Like this girl didn&#39;t quite know //how// to be a boy.&lt;/div&gt;

Your mother serves the simple stroganoff that was her favorite fast-prep meal typically reserved for a weeknight: noodles, canned mushroom soup, onions, and browned beef. It was hearty, the way you remember it, and you sit at the dinner table, chewing thoughtfully and thinking how long it has been since you tasted your mother&#39;s cooking.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Alex,&quot; your father says tentatively, about halfway through the meal. &quot;Your mother and I have been talking about it, and we&#39;ve decided we&#39;re going to pull you out of your school.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You stop with your fork halfway to your mouth, and put it down. //When did this happen?// You don&#39;t recall anything from your childhood about being taken out of school. Of course, you don&#39;t recall anything about growing up as a girl, either, but . . .&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;What for?&quot; you ask. &quot;Are we moving?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;No, sweetie,&quot; Dad replies. &quot;We&#39;re going to try to get you into an all-girls&#39; school. It&#39;ll be next year, when you&#39;re in fourth grade. Or later this year, if they&#39;ll let us transfer during the school year.&quot; He pauses, and asks, &quot;How does that sound?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;//A girls&#39; school? This never happened.// You struggle to think of a suitable response, but your adult mind seems to have deserted you, and you can only think to shrug and say &quot;I dunno.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;It&#39;s a really good school,&quot; your father says encouragingly. &quot;We&#39;ve done some asking around, and everyone says the students there are very bright, and a lot of them go on to do really well in junior high and high school. They have sports. You like sports, don&#39;t you? And they have talent shows, and art, and music. We think you&#39;ll really like it.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;But why?&quot; you ask. It&#39;s hard to put together your words. &quot;I don&#39;t want to go to a dumb old girls&#39; school. All my friends are at Stevens. And besides--&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Your mother interrupts you. &quot;Alex, it&#39;s time you put away this nonsense about not being a girl. This school is going to be a really good way for you to learn how to be a girl, and be around other girls. We just don&#39;t have time for this any more. It&#39;s time to grow up and stop pretending.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Okay,&quot; you say.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;This isn&#39;t sufficient for your mother, who gives you another Look. &quot;Promise me,&quot; she says. &quot;Promise me you&#39;ll stop this nonsense about pretending you&#39;re a boy. I&#39;ve had enough.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;With a frown, you dig into your dresser, looking for a suitable shirt. There are plenty of options, most of them rather boyish and un-feminine. You pull out a T-shirt with $Tshirt_choice on it and pull it on.&lt;/div&gt;

You still aren&#39;t quite sure what you&#39;re getting yourself into, because you hadn&#39;t expected to find yourself stuck as your nine-year-old self, much less a female version of that, but what&#39;s the worst that could happen? That mysterious woman who sent you back in time was bound to show up sooner or later to explain things.&lt;&lt;elseif $reaction == &quot;resist&quot;&gt;&gt;Your grudging acceptance to be a girl gets the skeptical approval of your parents. They probably don&#39;t think you&#39;re serious about it, but are willing to accept your promises for now. They&#39;ll probably be satisfied with some half-hearted attempt to pretend like you&#39;re a girl, at least for a while, and you know that sooner or later that mysterious woman who trapped you back in time is bound to turn up to put things right.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;Your parents aren&#39;t too pleased with your continued refusal to acknowledge that you&#39;re a girl. Still, what can they do about it, anyway? That mysterious woman who sent you back in time will be around sooner or later to explain things and put them right again. This whole stuck-in-the-past thing might not even be real. Why should you be expected to play along?&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Your mother and father start the application process with Oakbrook Montessori School for Girls, but they say it&#39;s going to take several weeks before the results will be known. Until then, they keep sending you back to South Stevens Elementary.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;It&#39;s weird, returning to your childhood elementary school as a girl. All your friends are there. All the students you remembered learning with as a child. The boys you played with. The girls you had run away from. The weird kids that nobody talked to. The pushy kids who liked to tease others. They&#39;re all here, just as if nothing had changed.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;But something //has// changed, and it&#39;s you. You are a girl now.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Do they know? They must.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Nobody else seems to remember you as a boy. Your parents certainly don&#39;t. And for better or worse, you //are// a girl now, physically. That first night in the bath -- what a surprise that was, realizing that you no longer had your willy to keep you company.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Maybe it //is// true. Maybe you really //are// a girl now.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;But that would be crazy. The //whole thing// is crazy. There&#39;s no way you&#39;ve been flipped backward in time to your own childhood and given a brand-new sex to grow up as. That is //super crazy.//&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Still, here you are.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;The other kids definitely treat you differently. The boys mostly stay away from you, although some of them like picking you for sports. You play as enthusiastically at recess as any boy. And the girls don&#39;t quite know what to make of you. They talk about you, huddled together and whispered, pointing, as you go by. //There she is, the girl who thinks she&#39;s a boy,// they&#39;re probably saying.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Maybe you should tell somebody. One of your friends -- Justin might believe you, maybe. You should tell him what had happened to you. He might not remember, but . . . but . . . well, you could try, right? You need allies.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Or maybe it would be better if you just keep your head down and study. Just ignore all of it. Try to get through this strange new world. Focus on school, forget the part about being a girl or a boy. Sooner or later this dream has to end, doesn&#39;t it?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;&lt;set $statbump to 1&gt;&gt;

You promised you&#39;d try to be ladylike from now on.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;back&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;A couple of days pass before you finally get fed up with all the teasing from the boys. One kid, Tommy Franz, pushes you out of the way of the drinking fountain in the hallway, knocking you into Belinda Morton. &quot;Boys go first at the drinking fountain,&quot; he says, as you and Belinda pick yourselves up off the floor.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You finally realize you&#39;ve had enough. You stand up, little fists clenched, feet spread apart, and confront Tommy. &quot;You better say you&#39;re sorry,&quot; you growl at him.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh, look, it&#39;s Alexandra the Great!&quot; Tommy laughs at you. He takes a drink and wipes his mouth on his sleeve. &quot;Sorry, //Alexandra.// Boys go first. Did you forget you were a girl again or something?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;That&#39;s when you aim a punch right at his face, connecting with your tiny fist right below his eye. Tommy stumbles back, hands raised, protesting, &quot;Hey! You crazy girl, I was just jok--&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;But you&#39;re not in the mood to listen to apologies. You&#39;ve been a girl for several days, you&#39;ve had to take //baths// like this, you&#39;ve had to use the girls&#39; bathroom and everything, you&#39;ve had your mom and dad getting on your case, and you&#39;re lost and confused and unmoored from your proper decade in history. Tommy just got in the way at the wrong time. You unleash another punch, drilling your knuckles into his big fat bicep, and he flinches away, howling in pain. You punch again, hitting his chest, his face. He&#39;s trying to protect himself against your wild swings from both fists, and finally he stumbles over his own shoelaces and falls down in the hallway, where he starts to cry.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;The boys don&#39;t bother you so much after that.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Your mom and dad aren&#39;t happy that you&#39;re picking fights with boys, but it seems like they disagree on how angry at you they&#39;re supposed to be. Fighting isn&#39;t very ladylike, but you were defending yourself. &quot;He probably just likes you,&quot; your mom tries to explain. &quot;Some boys do that with girls they like.&quot; Your father shakes his head, silencing your mom, and says, &quot;If boys push you around, you have my permission to push back.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Well, hopefully that won&#39;t be a problem in a few weeks,&quot; Mom says, with a significant glance at you. &quot;We just found out that you&#39;re going to get to transfer to Oakbrook Montessori, sweetie. Isn&#39;t that good news?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;//Great// news,&quot; your father says, before you can answer.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;We&#39;re going out this weekend to celebrate,&quot; Mom goes on. &quot;We&#39;ll shop for some new things you&#39;ll need. The girls at Oakbrook wear the //cutest// little skirts and sweaters, and you&#39;ll need some white stockings to go with it, and patent leather shoes. Oh!&quot; she gasps, clapping her hands in delight, in an ecstacy of schoolgirl shopping fantasy.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;So that&#39;s it. You&#39;re going to an all-girls&#39; school. That can only mean one thing: you&#39;re going to have to learn to be a girl.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;display &quot;Proceed to Oakbrook&quot;&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;display &quot;STR&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $friendson to 1&gt;&gt;

He&#39;s one of the boys in your class who hasn&#39;t tried speaking to you. It hurts a little to think of your best friend as too scared to talk to you, but you think you know why. The other kids probably think you&#39;re kind of weird: you&#39;re the girl who doesn&#39;t dress like a girl, and goes by a boy&#39;s name.&lt;&lt;if $reaction == &quot;accept&quot;&gt;&gt; Well, you&#39;ll be acting like a real girl from now on. That&#39;ll show them.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;One day at recess, you find Justin over by the big gray rock near the bus turnaround, sitting with his back to the school and watching the cars across the street pull in and out of the convenience store parking lot. He&#39;s sitting on top of the gray rock, waggling his feet, probably daydreaming.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Justin?&quot; you ask, standing at the base of the rock and looking up toward him. The stone isn&#39;t that big, not really; it just seems that way when you&#39;re nine years old again.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;He looks at you suspiciously. &quot;What?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Come here,&quot; you say, waving him down from the rock. &quot;I wanna tell you something secret.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;His look of suspicion persists for a moment longer, then he pushes off from the rock and lands in the gravel on his sneakers. &quot;What secret?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Get down,&quot; you say, crouching down behind the rock. &quot;I don&#39;t want anybody to see.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Obediently, Justin sits cross-legged beside you, and you mimic the gesture. It&#39;s amazing how flexible a nine-year-old body can be. You haven&#39;t sat this way for . . . for . . . well, since you were . . . whatever it was, in that foggy future.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;You know how my name is Alex?&quot; you ask, and he nods. &quot;And my real name is Alexandra?&quot; Another nod. &quot;Well, //actually// my name is Alexander. And I&#39;m a boy, okay? And I&#39;m from the future?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;He looks at you with a distant kind of interest. &quot;Like in &lt;&lt;if $this_year lt 1966&gt;&gt;//The Time Machine?//&quot;&lt;&lt;elseif $this_year lt 1981&gt;&gt;//Star Trek?//&quot;&lt;&lt;elseif $this_year lt 1984&gt;&gt;//Time Bandits?//&quot;&lt;&lt;elseif $this_year lt 1985&gt;&gt;//The Terminator?//&quot;&lt;&lt;elseif $this_year lt 1991&gt;&gt;//Back to the Future?&quot;//&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;//The Terminator?//&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; he asks. &quot;That kind of future?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yeah,&quot; you say. &quot;And I talked to this . . . there was this lady, and she said she was going to let me make some changes in the past and stuff? And she sent me back in time? Only now I&#39;m a girl.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;That&#39;s //kinda// cool,&quot; he says, grudgingly. &quot;Why did the lady do that?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I dunno,&quot; you answer. &quot;But like before, you and I were best friends, and we went to school together, and we grew up and stuff? But now that I&#39;m a girl and everything, we&#39;re not friends any more.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Hey, yeah,&quot; Justin says eagerly. &quot;And maybe she sent you back in time and turned you into a girl so me and you could like . . . &lt;&lt;if $this_year lt 1966&gt;&gt;go a zillion years into the future and fight a bunch of bad guys who live in the caves and are all white and hairy and stuff?&quot;&lt;&lt;elseif $this_year lt 1981&gt;&gt;go a zillion years into the past an&#39; get stuck in the olden days because the planet&#39;s going to explode and stuff?&quot;&lt;&lt;elseif $this_year lt 1984&gt;&gt;go traveling all over time and steal a bunch of really cool stuff like the Mona Lisa an&#39; the Leonardo de Milo and whatever?&quot;&lt;&lt;elseif $this_year lt 1985&gt;&gt;fight the Terminator and stuff? And you could have all these guns, and we could go fight the bad guys with &#39;em.&quot;&lt;&lt;elseif $this_year lt 1991&gt;&gt;go back to the 1950s an&#39; all over the place and we could fight the bad guys and then we have to fix everything?&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;fight the Terminator and stuff? And you could have all these guns, and we could go fight the bad guys with &#39;em.&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;No, I mean it&#39;s real,&quot; you say, frustrated. Justin thinks you&#39;re trying to play make-believe. He&#39;s just a dumb kid, he doesn&#39;t realize how you&#39;re trapped in time. &quot;No, it really happened. And we used to be friends and everything. Only now I&#39;m a girl and we&#39;re not friends.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I still think we should do my idea,&quot; Justin said sulkily.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Maybe,&quot; you concede, just to keep him happy. &quot;But look, I just had to tell somebody, &lt;&lt;if $reaction == &quot;accept&quot;&gt;&gt;because I&#39;m a girl now and I&#39;m stuck back in time and stuff.&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;because I&#39;m really a boy and it&#39;s all so weird being a girl and stuff.&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yeah, I bet,&quot; Justin said, but there was doubt in his voice. &quot;So look, maybe we should be friends a little, and if we see that lady come back, then maybe we&#39;ll have to figure out how to send you back and fix stuff.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You can&#39;t help but feel a little relief at the suggestion. Even if he&#39;s not quite convinced, at least you have an ally. &quot;Thanks, Justin,&quot; you say. For some reason, the thought arises that perhaps you should give him a kiss on the cheek for being so sweet, but you push the thought away. &quot;I want to still be friends too.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You don&#39;t tell your parents about the incident that night after school. In fact, you don&#39;t tell them at all, ever. You&#39;re pretty sure they&#39;re tired of hearing your stories about being a boy.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;They seem to be in a pretty good mood over dinner. Eventually, the reason comes out, as your father turns to you over meatloaf. &quot;Guess what, princess?&quot; he asks.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;We just found out that you&#39;re going to get to transfer to Oakbrook Montessori, sweetie,&quot; your mom says happily. &quot;Isn&#39;t that good news?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;//Great// news,&quot; your father says, before you can answer.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;We&#39;re going out this weekend to celebrate,&quot; Mom goes on. &quot;We&#39;ll shop for some new things you&#39;ll need. The girls at Oakbrook wear the //cutest// little skirts and sweaters, and you&#39;ll need some white stockings to go with it, and patent leather shoes. Oh!&quot; she gasps, clapping her hands in delight, in an ecstacy of schoolgirl shopping fantasy.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;So that&#39;s it. You&#39;re being taken away from your one and only friend, and being sent to an all-girls&#39; school. That can only mean one thing: you&#39;re going to have to learn to be a girl.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;display &quot;Proceed to Oakbrook&quot;&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;display &quot;CHA&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $friendson to 1&gt;&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;aside&quot;&gt;(You may now view your list of friends in the UI panel.)&lt;/span&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="23" name="Tomboy Study" tags="" position="800,1250" size="100,100">&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;For the next few weeks, you do your best to stay out of everyone&#39;s way. If people don&#39;t notice you, they won&#39;t bother you, and you won&#39;t have to be constantly reminded that you&#39;re a girl.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;As it turns out, the easiest place to hide is in the library. It&#39;s always open during recess, and there are plenty of books to read. You can usually find a quiet table off in the corner where you can huddle in a chair with a book. Nobody talks in the library, and that&#39;s just fine with you.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Eventually,  you start to recognize the other kids who hang out in the library during recess. With a little start of surprise, you notice your friend Russell -- well, he&#39;s not your friend right now, but he will be some day. Or he would have been. Russell comes into the library almost as often as you do, sitting near the encyclopedias and non-fiction books and reading about space exploration.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You don&#39;t remember meeting Russell until junior high. Did he really go to the same elementary school as you? You struggle to remember the old you, and the past of the future you had left behind. Perhaps Russell had been there all along, staying indoors, and you simply hadn&#39;t noticed him before. He certainly doesn&#39;t recognize you.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Russell . . . grows up and . . . who did he work for again? You wrack your nine-year-old memory for the name of the company Russell would eventually work for. You can&#39;t seem to remember it. Four Squares? Mr Soft? Was that it? It was something sciencey.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;One day during afternoon recess, you go to the science section and look at every book, thumbing idly through all the spines, trying to find something that would refresh your memory. Space. Rockets. //The Junior Science Book of the Solar System.// Sharks. //The Life of Benjamin Franklin.// What was it?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You see a title: &lt;&lt;if $this_year lt 1972&gt;&gt;//Danny Dunn and the Homework Machine.// It had a picture on the cover of a big box that was doing Danny&#39;s homework. That seemed familiar. But what was a &quot;computer?&quot;&lt;&lt;elseif $this_year lt 1978&gt;&gt;//Computers,// by Melvin Berger. That seemed familiar, but what was a &quot;computer?&quot;&lt;&lt;elseif $this_year lt 1982&gt;&gt;//101 Computer Games in BASIC.// That seemed familiar. Whatever a &quot;computer&quot; was, Russell would probably like it.&lt;&lt;elseif $this_year lt 1985&gt;&gt;//BASIC Fun: Computer Games, Puzzles and Problems Children Can Write.// That seemed familiar. Russell would probably like computers.&lt;&lt;elseif $this_year lt 1989&gt;&gt;//Meet the Computer,// by Simon Seymour. Russell would probably like computers.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;//Computers: Mechanical Minds// by Don Nardo. Russell loves computers, right?&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;The next time Russell comes in, you pick the book off the shelf for him, and put in on the table where he is reading. He looks over at it, and you push it toward him. &quot;It&#39;s for you,&quot; you whisper.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Russell stares at it, then at you, his mouth clamped shut. Then he gingerly pulls the book toward him, lowers his eyes, and says, &quot;Thanks.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;My name&#39;s Alex,&quot; you whisper. &quot;You&#39;re Russell, right?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;He nods, already flipping open the soft cover and looking at the inside of the book.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I hope you like the book,&quot; you say, and then you&#39;re so embarrassed at talking to a boy that you have to run back to your table and hide your face behind &lt;&lt;if $this_year lt 1972&gt;&gt;//Ramona the Pest.//&lt;&lt;elseif $this_year lt 1974&gt;&gt;//Tales of a Fourth-Grade Nothing.//&lt;&lt;elseif $this_year lt 1979&gt;&gt;//The Missing Piece.//&lt;&lt;elseif $this_year lt 1984&gt;&gt;//Flowers in the Attic.//&lt;&lt;elseif $this_year lt 1989&gt;&gt;//A Light in the Attic.//&lt;&lt;elseif $this_year lt 1993&gt;&gt;//Sweet Valley High: Lost at Sea.//&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;//Nancy Drew Files #82.//&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Talking to boys is a lot harder than you remember.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;display &quot;Proceed to Oakbrook&quot;&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;display &quot;INT&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $friendson to 1&gt;&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;aside&quot;&gt;(You may now view your list of friends in the UI panel.)&lt;/span&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="24" name="Oakbrook" tags="" position="1275,200" size="100,100">&lt;div class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;[img[09female.png]]&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;The school uniform for Oakbrook Montessori School for Girls is a strawberry-colored plaid pleated skirt, a strawberry-colored sweater, a cream-colored cotton blouse, pearl-white knee-length stockings, and patent-leather shoes. Beneath your blouse and skirt your mother makes you wear girls&#39; underwear and a white camisole. She is absolutely delighted, &lt;&lt;if $reaction == &quot;accept&quot;&gt;&gt;but you feel a little like your mother&#39;s toy dress-up doll. She even excavates all the old boyish clothing from your dresser and takes it to the Goodwill in trash bags. &quot;Remember, Allie,&quot; she says, as she&#39;s stuffing T-shirts into a bag. &quot;Only girls&#39; clothes from now on. That&#39;s the rule.&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;but you feel like an impostor. What&#39;s worse, mom takes absolute delight in excavating all your boyish clothing that you have in your dresser. &quot;Only girls&#39; clothes from now on, Allie,&quot; she says to you, as she drives you to the Goodwill to dispose of your old clothes. &quot;That&#39;s the rule.&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;&lt;set $school to 1&gt;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;That&#39;s the other thing. You&#39;re going to attend school under the name Allie now, not Alex. Your mother just likes the way Allie sounds, and she wants all your teachers to call you by that name. &quot;You&#39;ll get used to it,&quot; she assures you. &quot;It won&#39;t take long, I promise you. We used to call you Allie when you were a little girl.&quot; She&#39;s humming a lot more around the house, too, and she always seems to be thumbing dreamily through catalogs of girls&#39; clothing in your size.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;&lt;set $name to &quot;Allie&quot;&gt;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;On your first day at Oakbrook, you show up at the school with your mom, feeling &lt;&lt;if $reaction != &quot;refuse&quot;&gt;&gt;self-conscious&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;ridiculously girly&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; in your strawberry-colored skirt and blouse, your skinny legs encased in white knee-high stockings. The skirt swirls around your knees in a weird way, and your legs quickly get cold. Crowds of other girls, dressed exactly as you are, move around the school campus in little knots, talking to each other. Most of them have long hair, in every variety: pigtails, ponytails, long hair down the back, long curly hair, French braids. &lt;&lt;if $reaction == &quot;refuse&quot;&gt;&gt;You feel fiercely proud of your short, boyish cut, because it sets you apart from the other girls.&lt;&lt;elseif $reaction == &quot;accept&quot;&gt;&gt;You look longingly at the assortment of hairstyles and wonder when your hair will be long enough for any of them.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;You feel suddenly shy and self-conscious about your boyishly short haircut.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Relentless, your mother marches you down to the school office, trying to point out the amenities on campus, hoping to engage your interest: the bird bath, the flower garden, the little outdoor stage, the picnic tables. The other girls in their //darling// uniforms, just like yours. &quot;You&#39;re going to love it here,&quot; she assures you.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;In the office, she fills out some paperwork while you sit in a chair nearby, swinging your short legs with your little feet and patent-leather shoes. &quot;Allie,&quot; she calls to you. &quot;What do you want to sign up for as your elective? We&#39;ve got all your classes taken care of except that one. You can take art, French, or music.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $reaction == &quot;refuse&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;Those are all girly,&quot; you object.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&quot;I dunno,&quot; you say. &quot;Whatever.&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;You have to choose one,&quot; she says, exasperated. &quot;Come on, now. I haven&#39;t got time for this.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
— [[take art|Oakbrook2][$path.push(&quot;art&quot;)]]
— [[take French|Oakbrook2][$path.push(&quot;French&quot;)]]

The classes in Oakbrook Montessori contain mixed age groups: some have girls aged from 7 to 10, and others with girls 9 to 12, all learning similar subjects together, with the older girls helping the younger ones. Most of the students had been there starting in first grade, but there are new students like you who recently transfered in.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;It is hard to make friends at first, because everybody seems to know each other already, and have already formed little groups and cliques that don&#39;t have any room for you. You&#39;re too young for the older girls, who are already talking about boys and makeup and hair and clothes, and the younger girls are just too silly and immature with their ponies and unicorns and Tinkerbell backpacks. You don&#39;t really fit in anywhere at first. &lt;&lt;if $reaction == &quot;refuse&quot;&gt;&gt;That is fine with you, because you don&#39;t really feel like you belong at an all-girls&#39; school, no matter what kind of body you have, or what kind of skirts you mom makes you wear.&lt;&lt;elseif $reaction == &quot;resist&quot;&gt;&gt;It is a little lonely at first, but maybe once you get used to the idea that you&#39;ll be attending an all-girls&#39; school, maybe you&#39;ll start making friends.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;It is really lonely. You want to fit in and try to be a girl like the others, but you don&#39;t quite know how to make friends with them.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; You just know you don&#39;t want to end up like Jillian Murphy, the chubby girl with the blonde pigtails that sits with the unpopular girls at lunch.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;There is nowhere on campus to hide from all the girls. You can&#39;t even go hide in the bathroom, because all the bathrooms are for girls, except the ones for the male teachers next to the faculty lounge. And the bathrooms only have stalls -- no urinals for boys. Chrissy Snyder says boys can pee standing up, because her brother does it all the time and gets the toilet all dirty. You remember being able to do that yourself, but as the weeks go on, the memory starts to become a little hazy.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Your classes include all of the basics: math, English, science, geography, gym, and &lt;&lt;if $path.includes(&quot;French&quot;)&gt;&gt;your French elective. A lot of the girls want to take French because it&#39;s a Romance language, and that means it&#39;s the most romantic language in the whole world. Something about that seems wrong to you, but all the other girls seem pretty convinced of it, so it&#39;s hard to argue with them.&lt;&lt;elseif $path.includes(&quot;art&quot;)&gt;&gt;your art elective. It&#39;s mostly watercolors and clay sculpting, and most of the girls seem interested in painting horses, dresses, flowers, or pretty landscapes. You wonder if it might be fun to paint something else, like a car or a spaceship, but none of the other girls seem too excited about the idea.&lt;&lt;elseif $path.includes(&quot;music&quot;)&gt;&gt;your music elective. It&#39;s mostly singing and learning to read music from the chalkboard. The older girls&#39; voices are starting to change, separating them into altos and sopranos, and the younger girls keep a running debate going about which one it would be better to be. Those seem to be the only options for girls.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Every day is the same. You get up for school and put on the same uniform: the strawberry skirt, the white stockings, the cream-colored blouse, the cardigan. Your mother drives you to the school and drops you off, and you spend the day in a crowd of pleated skirts and ponytails and giggling, girly voices.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Every day, the same routine.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Was something going to happen?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You keep waiting to catch sight of the mysterious woman, the one who sent you back in time. You can&#39;t remember what she looks like, but she must be around here somewhere. She //must// be. You can&#39;t just turn somebody into a girl and leave them in the past twenty years ago and go //away.// It wouldn&#39;t be //fair.// Here you are, trying to go to school, a girls&#39; school, and all you really wanted to do was to change your life a little bit.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;This is changing your life //a lot.// Like a lot, a lot. Super a lot.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;But there&#39;s no sign of her. You don&#39;t see her at Oakbrook, and you don&#39;t see her at home. When your mom takes you shopping, you don&#39;t see her at the mall either. You can&#39;t really go anywhere else, can you? You&#39;re just a girl, you can&#39;t go back to the bar -- even if you could remember which bar it had been, even if it exists in this decade, even you know that bars are for grown-ups. They won&#39;t let a little girl in.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;What are you supposed to //do// in the past? What is she waiting for? What are you going to do while you wait for a chance to talk to her again?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;&lt;set $statbump to 2&gt;&gt;

Sure, you did all this stuff before when you used to be a boy or whatever, but it&#39;s hard to remember all of it. Your elementary school days are . . . well, maybe they&#39;re not exactly behind you, but it&#39;s sure been a long time since you had to know this stuff, and you weren&#39;t that smart to begin with.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;And anyway, you&#39;re not here to make friends with a bunch of girls. You got sent here to make changes in your life, and hanging out chatting with girls probably doesn&#39;t count. Studying probably counts, though, so you decide there&#39;s no harm in applying yourself.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;It&#39;s weird, too. You didn&#39;t used to be good at school, and it wasn&#39;t all that fun or anything, but the more you hang out in the library, the easier it gets. You start remembering things in class. Your reading improves.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Plus, there&#39;s this girl who&#39;s always in the library. She&#39;s a cute girl with blond hair, the same age as you. You introduce yourself as Allie, and she introduces herself as Courtney Miller. &quot;My dad&#39;s a doctor,&quot; she says, &quot;but I&#39;m gonna be a vet&#39;rinarian when I grow up, so I can work with cats and rabbits and puppies. What are you going to be?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You don&#39;t really have an answer for that. You never knew what you wanted to be when you grew up, and you still don&#39;t.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;You should be a teacher, then,&quot; Courtney decides firmly. &quot;My mom&#39;s a teacher here. She&#39;s really good. She says teaching is the best job in the world except for the money.&quot; Courtney contrives to sound unimpressed by the idea of money, although clearly her parents have some, or she wouldn&#39;t be here.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;And that&#39;s the way your days go, for the next few months: attending class in your little skirt, sharing books with Courtney in the library during break times, and studying &lt;&lt;if $path.includes(&quot;French&quot;)&gt;&gt;French.&lt;&lt;elseif $path.includes(&quot;art&quot;)&gt;&gt;watercolors.&lt;&lt;elseif $path.includes(&quot;music&quot;)&gt;&gt;music.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

You can&#39;t go back on a promise and stuff. What if they find out? Man, you&#39;d be in //such bad trouble.//

&lt;&lt;back&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You&#39;re not going to let that strange lady win and turn you into a girl and stuff. You&#39;ve decided. You&#39;re going to keep being a boy as much as you possibly can, and if Mom doesn&#39;t like it, then //she// can go to the dumb old girls&#39; school.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;So you try to maintain your cool, boyish exterior. You try to be tough. You try not to give in, or do all the fun things the other girls want to do, like paint their fingernails or learn how to braid and stuff. Sure, it //looks// like fun, but you&#39;re not going to fall for that. Once you start down the path of being all girly, there&#39;s probably no going back.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You&#39;re not exactly sure that&#39;s true, but it sounds like something Yoda said, so it&#39;s probably pretty close.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;All this acting-like-a-boy stuff ends up making you pretty strong, for a girl. It must be all the climbing over fences, and running, and playing tetherball and stuff. That&#39;s what all the exercise does. Plus, it makes you thinner and leaner. The other girls give you jealous looks of how skinny you are, and you&#39;re secretly pretty happy with it yourself. You don&#39;t want to end up fat like Jillian Murphy. All the girls tease her for having a big butt, and you don&#39;t want that to be you.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;There&#39;s this girl who likes to play tetherball, Tara Perez, who has really cool long dark hair and almond-shaped eyes. She&#39;s super tough to beat at tetherball, and she&#39;s really fun to hang out with after school. She&#39;s fast, too.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;You&#39;re super good at tetherball, Tara,&quot; you tell her one day as you&#39;re playing.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I know,&quot; she says confidently. &quot;I beat a boy once. It was at the park.&quot; She giggles confidentially. &quot;Oh, he got //so// mad, losing to a girl.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Maybe it was a big deal to him,&quot; you say, feeling like you should stick up for the boy.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;So what?&quot; she says with an indifferent shrug. She tosses up the ball again and serves it. &quot;If boys cry over losing to girls, I&#39;m glad I&#39;m not a boy. That sounds //totally// dumb.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yeah,&quot; you agree, to keep the peace, and to improve your reputation for being tough. &quot;Boys //are// pretty dumb.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;And that&#39;s the way your days go, for the next few months: attending class in your little skirt, playing tetherball with Tara during break times, and studying &lt;&lt;if $path.includes(&quot;French&quot;)&gt;&gt;French.&lt;&lt;elseif $path.includes(&quot;art&quot;)&gt;&gt;watercolors.&lt;&lt;elseif $path.includes(&quot;music&quot;)&gt;&gt;music.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

There&#39;s all these girls to talk to, so there&#39;s got to be somebody here who would be nice and fun to talk to.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;&lt;display &quot;SetMovie&quot;&gt;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;So you start going up to groups of girls who are talking together, trying to work your way into their conversations and to introduce yourself. It&#39;s not easy. Some of the girls just roll their eyes and walk away when you try to crowd in. A few of them make sharp remarks -- about your short boyish hair, about your lack of feminine grace, about your lack of earrings or makeup, about your weight, about your lack of friends. Fortunately, there aren&#39;t many girls like that.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;One afternoon before math class, you hear a group of girls talking about a movie that sounds familiar, but you can&#39;t quite put your finger on whether you&#39;ve seen it or not. &quot;Oh my God, he was //so cute,//&quot; says one of the girls, a redhead with blue eyes and a big, beaming smile. She sighs theatrically. &quot;I mean, he&#39;s super old probably, but anyway I don&#39;t care, because $hot_actor is //so cute.//&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;An Asian girl with braces looks at her in awe. &quot;Your parents let you go see that?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;The first girl flips her hair back in a superior way. &quot;My mom lets me see anything I want, even if it&#39;s rated R.&quot; She turns to you. &quot;So, did you see it too?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;See what?&quot; you ask.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;//$hot_movie,//&quot; says the redhead. &quot;It&#39;s //so// good. You should totally see it.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh, right,&quot; you say, remembering. &quot;I remember that movie.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;A blonde girl with pigtails looks at you suspiciously. &quot;You //remember// it?&quot; she asks.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh,&quot; you say, and realize you might have slipped up. &quot;Yeah, uh, I saw it like forever ago.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;It just came out,&quot; the blonde objects, but the redhead says excitedly, &quot;You saw it a long time ago? That&#39;s so awesome. Do you see a lot of movies before they come out?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Sometimes, I guess,&quot; you explain. &quot;Yeah.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;The other girls are suitably excited about your secret source of inside knowledge about movies and stuff, and they introduce themselves. &quot;I&#39;m Whitney,&quot; the redhead says. &quot;What&#39;s your name?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I&#39;m Allie.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;And I&#39;m Jacquelyn,&quot; says the Asian girl.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;So, what else did you see?&quot; Whitney asks brightly. &quot;//$next_movie,// have you seen that?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh, yeah, I&#39;m pretty sure,&quot; you say, trying to remember. &quot;It was a while ago.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Wow!&quot; Jacqueline says. The blonde girl sulks nearby, unhappy that her suspicions are being disregarded.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;That&#39;s the way your days go, for the next few months: attending class in your little skirt, talking about movies with Whitney and Jacqueline during break times, and studying &lt;&lt;if $path.includes(&quot;French&quot;)&gt;&gt;French.&lt;&lt;elseif $path.includes(&quot;art&quot;)&gt;&gt;watercolors.&lt;&lt;elseif $path.includes(&quot;music&quot;)&gt;&gt;music.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The calendar rolls from $year to &lt;&lt;set $this_year to $year + 1&gt;&gt;$this_year. The seasons change from winter to spring. The trees begin to bud with thousands of tiny, bright green leaves. And there is no sign of the woman.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;One day, as you are walking home from Oakbrook with a couple of the girls who live in your area, you&#39;re talking about the change in the weather. One of them, Tina, a gloomy pale-haired girl with fair skin and freckles, says, &quot;Yeah, but it&#39;s still so //cold.// It never gets warm until like //July//.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;It gets warm before //that,//&quot; you object reasonably.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Nuh uh,&quot; Tina declares stubbornly. &quot;It&#39;s only warm for like //one day// in July and then it gets cold again. That&#39;s why I hate wearing skirts.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I know, me too,&quot; you say. It&#39;s no use arguing with Tina, who complains about everything and exaggerates about a million times a day. &quot;It took me forever to get used to wearing a skirt. This whole winter, my legs were freezing like practically off.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;You don&#39;t wear skirts?&quot; asks Val, an older girl with short brown hair. &quot;God, I love skirts in the summer time.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;My legs still get cold,&quot; Tina grumbles, trying to return the topic back to her complaining, but nobody was listening.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;No, I never wore skirts before,&quot; you answer. &quot;Not until I came here to Oakbrook.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Wow,&quot; Val says, eyes wide. &quot;I couldn&#39;t imagine. My favorite skirt--&quot; but as she babbles on about the clothes in her closet, you have stopped cold on the sidewalk, mouth open. Your brain is racing madly. //I never wore skirts before because I was never a girl before,// you realize. //And I totally forgot. I got so caught up in homework and going to school and stuff, I totally forgot.//&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Did you forget something at school?&quot; Tina asks. &quot;I bet you have to go back. And I bet it&#39;s closed by now. I hate it when I do that.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;//I did. I did forget something,// you realize. //I forgot I&#39;m supposed to be watching for the woman.// You peer around, taking in the neighborhood: the houses, the light afternoon traffic, the scudding gray clouds, the green lawns. It&#39;s as if you think the strange woman is going to be here, watchng you this minute.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Allie?&quot; Val asks, concerned.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I&#39;m okay,&quot; you respond weakly. &quot;Yeah, I forgot something. I&#39;ll have to write it down when I get home.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Nice dress, Lexi Luthor,&quot; he says jokingly, standing up straight. &quot;Did you mom finally find out you&#39;re a girl?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Nice face,&quot; you answer sharply, making a fist. &quot;Want me to punch it in again?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;He backs away, putting the pylon between you. &quot;Naw, I was just joking. Nothin&#39; personal.&quot; He pauses. &quot;So you go to a different school now?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yeah, my mom and dad decided to send me to Oakbrook Montessori,&quot; you say. &quot;It&#39;s all girls. Everybody has to wear the same uniform.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;It&#39;s . . . nice,&quot; he says grudgingly, looking over your school clothes. &quot;But it&#39;s too bad you don&#39;t get to go Stevens any more. You could wear whatever you want.&quot; It almost sounds as if he says he misses you. //But not really,// you think.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I wish I could,&quot; you say. &quot;All my friends are here. It&#39;s hard, going to a new school and making new friends.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I bet it&#39;s super hard,&quot; he says, his eyes going down to the ground. &quot;Anyway, I&#39;ll see you around, okay? Nice talking to you.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You walk past him, continuing on your route toward home, and leave Tommy Franz standing by the gate to South Stevens. //That was weird,// you think.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;&lt;elseif $friends.includes(&quot;Justin&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;As you walk along, lost in thought, your delicate brow furrowed in concentration, you almost don&#39;t notice Justin Mayer up ahead. He&#39;s riding his bike around the rough, grassy field just inside the chain-link fence gate to South Stevens Elementary. Justin is trying to pop wheelies on his three-speed bike, and he keeps glancing over toward you to see if you are noticing his efforts. As you get closer, he seems to recognize you, and rides toward the gate and dismounts.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Hey, Alex,&quot; he says. &quot;I haven&#39;t seen you since you moved.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I didn&#39;t move,&quot; you explain, and gesture at your girly school clothes. &quot;I just changed schools.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh,&quot; he says, rather lamely, and tries again. &quot;So you have to wear girls&#39; clothes at your new school, huh? Is that like a rule or something?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yeah, they make everybody,&quot; you sigh. &lt;&lt;if $reaction == &quot;refuse&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;It&#39;s kind of dumb. And everybody calls me Allie there.&quot;&lt;&lt;elseif $reaction == &quot;accept&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;It&#39;s okay, though. And everybody calls me Allie now.&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&quot;And everybody calls me Allie now.&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Justin is thoughtfully silent for a moment, then he says, &quot;Hey, you remember that day we were playing? And you said that you were from the future and everything? And we were gonna play like you used to be a boy, but you got turned into a girl?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You nod at him. &quot;Sure, I remember.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Justin scrutinizes you carefully. &quot;Was that true?&quot; he blurts out. Then, red-faced, he goes on: &quot;Because, like we never got to play that or anything, and right after you told me that, like your parents told you to go to a different school and stuff, and it&#39;s like they were trying to keep you from telling me about it, like they were mad, and they didn&#39;t want anybody to find out. So I was just . . . wondering.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You aren&#39;t sure how to explain. It&#39;s so hard to remember everything that&#39;s happened since you were sent into the past. &quot;Yeah, it&#39;s true,&quot; you say. &quot;And yeah, mom and dad don&#39;t like it when I say I used to be a &lt;&lt;if $reaction == &quot;accept&quot;&gt;&gt;boy, so I kinda promised them I wouldn&#39;t do that any more.&quot;&lt;&lt;elseif $reaction == &quot;refuse&quot;&gt;&gt;boy, but I don&#39;t care, because it&#39;s still totally true.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;boy, so I don&#39;t really talk about it much at home any more.&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Justin nods somberly. &quot;That&#39;d be so weird,&quot; he says, his imagination taking him off another flight of fancy. &quot;Like, to be sent back in time, and have to be a totally different person. Do you see anybody else from the future?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;No, not really.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Well, if you need help finding any,&quot; Justin says, &quot;just call me. That sounds really cool, looking for time travelers an&#39; stuff.&quot; He scuffs his feet in the well-trodden dirt that lies in the gap between the chain-link fence, and says, &quot;Well, I&#39;m gonna go. It&#39;s prob&#39;ly dinner soon.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;See you later,&quot; you say.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;//Well, that was weird,// you think, as you resume your route toward home.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;&lt;elseif $friends.includes(&quot;Russell&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;As you walk along, lost in thought, your delicate brow furrowed in concentration, you almost don&#39;t notice Russell Chao up ahead. He&#39;s walking along the sidewalk in a slow, absent-minded shuffle, playing with &lt;&lt;if $year lt 1977&gt;&gt;an electronic calculator.&lt;&lt;elseif $year lt 1984&gt;&gt;a Mattel electronic football game.&lt;&lt;elseif $year lt 1989&gt;&gt;a Tomytronic 3D Shark Attack game.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;a Nintendo Gameboy.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; You practically walk right into him in the middle of the sidewalk.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh, sorry,&quot; you say, apologizing, and then you realize that it&#39;s Russell.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh,&quot; Russell says, looking around vaguely. &quot;I didn&#39;t see you.&quot; He turns off the device and peers more closely at you. &quot;Did you used to go to my school?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You nod at him. &quot;Yeah. We met before in the library. But then my parents made me change schools.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Russell nods, fiddling absently with the inactive plastic buttons. &quot;I remember. You gave me a book on computers, right? Yeah,&quot; he says, recalling the day. &quot;It was a good book. Thanks.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You feel a little pink blush creep onto your face and stay there. &quot;You&#39;re welcome,&quot; you say lamely. &quot;I think you used to like computers. I mean, I . . . I thought you&#39;d like it. Them. So I gave it to you.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Russell looks down at his feet. &quot;Thanks.&quot; He doesn&#39;t appear to know what else to say.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;How&#39;s school?&quot; you ask him.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh, you know, it&#39;s pretty fun,&quot; he says, looking up for a moment, but unable to maintain eye contact. He looks across the street instead. &quot;I like it. It&#39;s pretty easy for me.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;That&#39;s because you&#39;re smart,&quot; you say confidently. &quot;You&#39;re going to go on and . . . you&#39;ll be really smart when you grow up,&quot; you conclude. It&#39;s //so// hard to remember the future sometimes. &quot;I just know it. And I think there&#39;s going to be a lot of &lt;&lt;if $year lt 1985&gt;&gt;computering in the future.&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;computers in the future.&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Me too,&quot; Russell says, and his nod is enthusiastic. &lt;&lt;if $year lt 1985&gt;&gt;After a moment of hestitation, he corrects you: &quot;And I think the word is //computing.// Not //computering.// I never heard anybody say the word //computering.//&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You blush harder. &quot;&lt;&lt;if $year lt 1985&gt;&gt;Computing. Okay. &lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;Well, you&#39;re going to do really good at it.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh, probably,&quot; he says, but he isn&#39;t boasting. He&#39;s usually good at stuff. That&#39;s just how Russell is.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You&#39;re too embarrassed to keep talking to him, so you have to run away. //Well, that was kinda weird,// you think as you run off down the sidewalk toward home.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;At your desk there is a fresh spiral notebook, and you take out a pencil and begin to write. //I used to be a boy,// you write, then cross out //boy// and write //man.// It looks funny on the page, written in your girly penmanship: big loops and neat, feminine circles. //There was a woman in a bar and she asked if I wanted to change my life. I probably said yes. And then I was back in $year and I was falling out of the tree that one day and Mom was there and she was so mad I got in so much trouble. And that&#39;s when Mom said . . .//&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You&#39;re starting to get off topic. You frown in annoyance and erase the last couple of words, brushing stray eraser off the page. &lt;&lt;if $reaction == &quot;refuse&quot;&gt;&gt;//I&#39;m not supposed to be a girl.//&lt;&lt;elseif $reaction == &quot;resist&quot;&gt;&gt;//I&#39;m not a girl, not really.//&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;//I wasn&#39;t always a girl.//&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; That sounded better. It sounded more familiar. //I haven&#39;t seen that woman again. I don&#39;t even know who she is. She looked like . . .//&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You stare into space, looking at the page. //I can&#39;t remember what she looked like,// you finally conclude. //But I hope I&#39;ll run into her again and she&#39;ll tell me what&#39;s going on.//&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;The words on the page are a little comforting, and you resolve to read them every day so you don&#39;t forget. Living in the past like this, it&#39;s hard to remember the future, so you need this journal to remind you.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;And Mom had better not find it.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You look around your room for a good place to hide it, and put it into a drawer. After a moment&#39;s thought, you write //HOMEWORK// on the cover so she doesn&#39;t get too curious.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;There. You have a journal, and you have a plan. Somewhere, somehow, you&#39;re going to find that weird lady again and you&#39;re going to make her explain what she did to you.&lt;/div&gt;

She doesn&#39;t turn up before the following school year, either.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;if $path.includes(&quot;French&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Your third-grade beginning French class turns into fourth-grade French, and you&#39;re surprised at how easy it is to learn a new language.

Because you never tried before, of course.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;&lt;elseif $path.includes(&quot;art&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Your third-grade art class turns into a fourth-grade performing arts class, reading plays and doing acting on stage.

Because you never tried before, of course.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Your third-grade music class turns into fourth-grade voice lessons. You&#39;re starting to get much better control of your breath and your singing voice, and it&#39;s surprisingly fun. Why did you never do this before? Because you never tried before, of course.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Next summer rolls around, and there&#39;s still no sign of her. There&#39;s not even a glimpse of her -- whoever she is, whatever she looks like -- to be seen anywhere. You //know// that you&#39;ll recognize her when you see her, you&#39;re //sure// of it. You have to be. What other hope do you have?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Meanwhile, your journal is the only thing that keeps you company. Of course you have friends, and your newly-young life is filled with birthday parties, vacations, sleepovers, weekends at the fair, and tons of other super fun stuff, &lt;&lt;if $friends.includes(&quot;Justin&quot;)&gt;&gt;but apart from your journal, only Justin knows that you&#39;re stuck back in time as a girl.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;but only your journal knows that you&#39;re stuck back in time as a girl.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; It&#39;s a lonely way to live.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Every day you read your previous journal entries and try to remember something else about the future. Then every other day. Then once a week. It&#39;s super hard to keep wracking your brains for details about your old life as a boy. &lt;&lt;if $reaction == &quot;accept&quot;&gt;&gt;Even though you&#39;ve decided to accept being a girl for now, you don&#39;t like the way those details of your old life keep slipping away.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;You really want to hang onto all those details, but they keep slipping away.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; It&#39;s even harder to separate the things you //think// you know from the things you //want// to be true. One day you&#39;re convinced you used to be on television, but then the next day, that memory doesn&#39;t seem familiar at all. //Is any of this stuff true?// you ask yourself, looking through your previous entries. //How much? Just some of it? Which parts?//&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Your parents send you back to Oakbrook for the 4th grade, of course, and by the time 5th grade rolls around, you&#39;re already expecting it. You&#39;re even looking forward to it, a little. You have lots of friends there now.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Before you go back, we have to go shopping,&quot; mom says one day, in the late summer. &quot;This is important. You&#39;ll need new school clothes, plus you&#39;re going to need something //else.//&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;What?&quot; you ask.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;You&#39;re going to need a training bra,&quot; she says, and when you make a face, she says, &quot;No buts, Allie. It&#39;s time. You&#39;re starting to pop out a little, and we can&#39;t let you go to school with your little boobs starting to show.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;if $reaction == &quot;accept&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Okay,&quot; you say. You knew this was going to happen sooner or later. That&#39;s what happens when you grow up as a girl, isn&#39;t it? Apparently so, because your mother takes you shopping at a department store, making you stand in the Little Misses department while she holds up one training bra after another, measuring around your middle with the band to see how well it fits. &quot;You&#39;re going to want one that fits nice and snug, but not too tight,&quot; she explains. &quot;There&#39;s a couple of sets of hooks on here, see? You can adjust it when you start to grow out of it.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;How long does it take?&quot; you ask. The training bra is, to be honest, depressingly flat and empty. It&#39;s the kind of thing a //child// world wear, but you&#39;re not a child any more. Well, not really.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I developed late,&quot; mom says. &quot;I bet a few of the girls your age are starting to develop, but not all of them will. It&#39;ll take a couple of years before all of your bodies are on the same page. It might be a while, sweetie.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;A couple of years? You frown, wrinkling your nose as your mother flips through racks of tiny brassieres. &quot;Will I get big boobs or little boobs?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;We&#39;ll see,&quot; she says implacably, taking one of her selections and arranging the rejects back on their plastic hangers. &quot;Some girls get bigger boobs than others. Now your grandma, my mom, she got pretty big breasts, and she developed pretty early. Your other grandma, Nana Bartlett, she didn&#39;t grow very big at all. I&#39;m kind of in the middle.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Oh, good. One more thing to have to worry about.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Mom!&quot; you object, but there&#39;s no possible way to forestall the inevitable. Your mother //drags// you to the department store and makes you stand in the Little Misses department while she holds up one training bra after another, measuring around your middle with the band to see how well it fits. &quot;You&#39;re going to want one that fits nice and snug, but not too tight,&quot; she explains. &quot;There&#39;s a couple of sets of hooks on here, see? You can adjust it when you start to grow out of it.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Do I have to?&quot; you ask petulantly. This is //so// embarrassing. What if one of your friends sees you?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yes, you have to,&quot; she says. &quot;I bet a lot of girls your age are starting to wear them. You&#39;ll just have to get used to it. This one is just for now -- when your boobs start to grow, we&#39;ll get you a bigger one.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;A //bigger// one?&quot; you demand. &quot;I don&#39;t have to have boobs, do I?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;We&#39;ll see,&quot; she says implacably, taking one of her selections and arranging the rejects back on their plastic hangers. &quot;Some girls get bigger boobs than others. Now your grandma, my mom, she got pretty big breasts, and she developed pretty early. Your other grandma, Nana Bartlett, she didn&#39;t grow very big at all. I&#39;m kind of in the middle.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;So what&#39;s going to happen to me?&quot; you sulk. &quot;Am I going to end up like you, or am I going to have to have big fat boobs like Grandma Wells?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;We&#39;ll see,&quot; she says again. &quot;Come on, you&#39;re getting to be a big girl. It happens to all little girls when they grow up, and there&#39;s nothing to be done about it.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Oh, good. This on top of everything else.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Miss Haverhill takes you aside after math class one day in April, just after the posters have gone up. &quot;I was wondering if you wanted to get involved behind the scenes for the talent show,&quot; she asks you. &quot;We like to see our girls get some experience organizing our talent show every year, and I think it would be a good experience for you.

We&#39;ve got Jody Stafford and Tara Perez building the sets, so if you&#39;re good with tools and want to get your hands a little dirty, they could probably use some help.

Sure, it&#39;s hard work, and your muscles are aching by the time you get done every day: stretching canvas tightly over the wooden frames, tacking it down, flipping the flats over and meticulously stapling the cloth to the back of the boards. &lt;&lt;if $path.includes(&quot;tetherball at Oakbrook&quot;)&gt;&gt;On the other hand, it&#39;s really good exercise, and you make a new friend.

Tara and Jody already knew each other, having played lots of kickball in their neighborhood. Tara likes to boast that they beat a team of //boys// once, which seems pretty impressive.

When Brooke is around, the other girls leave you and Courtney alone.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;but it&#39;s good mental exercise, and Brooke and Courtney turn out to be fun girls to work with. Courtney is super smart and reads tons of books all the time, which sometimes causes her to get teased.

And Jacquelyn is this Asian girl with braces who&#39;s really smart and kinda quiet but she&#39;s really encouraging and fun to be with.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; Plus, you get to meet their friends Angelica Flores, who is really funny and pretty, and Jamie Webb, a gregarious black girl with a big smile and who is like friends with //everyone// at the school.

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I wasn&#39;t going to have this talk with you until next year,&quot; she says, &quot;but since you&#39;re going to be away all next year, I think we&#39;re going to have to rush things just a little bit. You might not be ready to hear any of this yet, but I want you remember it, okay, sweetie?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;She pushes the book into your limp little hands, while you look around the green lawn of the park for a hole that you can crawl into and die. &quot;This book has a lot of information in it, and we&#39;re going to go over all of it today. That&#39;s why we&#39;re having this picnic without Daddy. This is girl stuff, just you and me, okay?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;To your immense embarrassment, she starts to tell you thinks about sex and menstruation and boys while the earth //completely fails// to swallow you up forever.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;And that&#39;s not even the worst of it. All the girl stuff happens to you in France, and it seems like you&#39;re the only girl in the universe that doesn&#39;t already know about it. All the French girls seem to be perfectly aware of what&#39;s happening to their bodies, but you&#39;re the silly foreign exchange student who doesn&#39;t know anything.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;There&#39;s no time to think of your time-traveling diary, the notebook that says //HOMEWORK// on the front, because you&#39;re just too busy. There&#39;s so much to do. You&#39;re in //collège//, or middle school, and it&#39;s very hard to keep up. You spend most of your evenings crawling through your homework, looking up every other word in your French dictionary because you haven&#39;t learned it yet. Plus, you&#39;re taking classes in European history, civics, art, and physical education.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You start to have periods, just like mom said you would. But even that isn&#39;t the worst part. No, it gets worse. That&#39;s when your boobs start to grow. Now everybody //knows// you&#39;re a girl, just by looking at you. There&#39;s no getting away from it.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;It makes it difficult to really enjoy your time in France. Sure, there&#39;s tons of new things to learn, and your French is //amazing// now, and there&#39;s so much cheese to try, and your host family even lets you try a sip of wine (which is somehow a lot more bitter and less fun than you remember) with dinner most nights. Still, you feel weird living with this strange, nice, helpful French family while your breasts start inflating up like you&#39;re Balloon Girl.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;At first, it&#39;s easy to hide it from everybody by wearing two shirts at once. After a while that stops working, and to your mortal embarrassment your host mother Claire notices loudly at breakfast that you&#39;re starting to burst out up top, and your jeans don&#39;t fit so well in the hips any more. She takes you to a nice French market to shop for something that fits, and you have mixed feelings about that, because it&#39;s all French fashion, but Claire is so familiar with you, tugging clothes on your body, helping you undress, that you just want to //die.// &lt;&lt;if $path.includes(&quot;balanced&quot;) or $path.includes(&quot;social&quot;)&gt;&gt;You start off with an A-cup bra, which is okay, but then you start to grow out of that one too, and your host mother hauls you back to the store to buy you a B-cup. Then you start to overflow those cups as well. Of course when you get off the plane back at home in America, your mom makes a huge fuss over them and takes you out //again// to go shopping. Your boobs are still growing at the end of the summer. When will these things stop?&lt;&lt;set $path.push(&quot;large boobs&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $boobs to 3&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;elseif $path.includes(&quot;mental&quot;)&gt;&gt;You start off with an A-cup bra, which is okay, but then you start to grow out of that one too.

You only take your journal out of your desk drawer when you need to dig through your desk looking for something. You&#39;re //never// going to get out of here, you&#39;re sure of it.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;In the middle of the year, something happens that reminds you of your predicament, and it sends you rushing back for your diary of the half-forgotten future. This is the year that you get The Talk.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;One Saturday, while your father stays home, your mom takes you out for a picnic at the park. You don&#39;t suspect anything is unusual until she pulls out of the picnic basket a little book with the embarrassing title of //You And Your Growing Body.// It has a drawing of a girl in a dress on it, and it looks kind of old. Immediately you go pink in the face.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Sweetie, it&#39;s time we had a talk about what&#39;s going to be happening for the next few years,&quot; mom says, pushing the book into your limp little hands, while you look around the green lawn of the park for a hole that you can crawl into and die. &quot;This book has a lot of information in it, and we&#39;re going to go over all of it today. That&#39;s why we&#39;re having this picnic without Daddy. This is girl stuff, just you and me, okay?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;To your immense embarrassment, she starts to tell you thinks about sex and menstruation and boys while the earth //completely fails// to swallow you up forever.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;And that&#39;s somehow not the worst part of it. All the 6th-grade girls at Oakbrook Montessori are trooped into a room on their own, without any of the younger girls, and you have to watch a program &lt;&lt;if $this_year lt 1980&gt;&gt;on a filmstrip&lt;&lt;elseif $this_year lt 1990&gt;&gt;on videotape&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;on video&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; about the same thing, except it&#39;s about a million years old and all your friends are there. It&#39;s degrading. You&#39;re not even a . . . well, you kind of are a girl, but that&#39;s not what&#39;s //supposed// to be happening. How did you end up like this?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You start to have periods, just like mom said you would. But even that isn&#39;t the worst part. No, it gets worse. That&#39;s when your boobs start to grow. Now everybody //knows// you&#39;re a girl, just by looking at you. There&#39;s no getting away from it.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Toward the end of sixth grade, and throughout the following summer, your breasts start getting bigger. At first, it&#39;s easy to hide it from your parents by wearing two shirts at once. After a while that stops working and your mom begins to notice that you&#39;re starting to burst out up top, and your jeans don&#39;t fit so well in the hips any more. She drags you out shopping again, //of course.// &lt;&lt;if $path.includes(&quot;balanced&quot;) or $path.includes(&quot;social&quot;)&gt;&gt;You start off with an A-cup bra, which is okay, but then you start to grow out of that one too, and your mother hauls you back to the store to buy you a B-cup.

Mom and Dad apparently consider the experiment a sucess.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;After the sixth grade, you&#39;re no longer attending an all-girls private academy. Instead, you&#39;re attending the public junior high school. Mom and Dad apparently consider the experiment a success. Four years of attending Oakbrook, with only other girls for company, has apparently done the trick.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; Your hair has grown out a little, you&#39;re starting to wear earrings and makeup, and you&#39;re starting to look like a young lady. You&#39;re filling out in a lot of uncomfortably feminine ways, but to mom and dad, that&#39;s just another sign that things are going the way they ought to.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;More importantly, you&#39;re now going to a school with //boys// again. You can tell they have high hopes that being around boys again won&#39;t derail the last four years of your progress toward womanhood.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;if $friends.includes(&quot;Tommy&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You run into Tommy during your very first week in junior high. He&#39;s a lot taller than you remember, &lt;&lt;if $likes_boys gt 0&gt;&gt;and a lot cuter, too. His voice has started to drop down and he&#39;s got this little mustache that he&#39;s trying to grow.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;and he&#39;s definitely older. His voice has dropped and he&#39;s got this faint wisp of peach-fuzz mustache on his lip.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Hey, Alex,&quot; he says, giving you a sheepish nod in the hall. &quot;You go to this school now?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yeah,&quot; you say. &quot;Same as everybody else. And I go by Allie now.&quot; &lt;&lt;if $likes_boys gt 0&gt;&gt;It&#39;s hard to make eye contact, so you just cling on tighter to your books.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;You feel like he&#39;s staring at you, so you hold your books over your chest protectively.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;That&#39;s cool,&quot; he says grudgingly. &quot;Anyway, it&#39;s good to see you. Maybe we&#39;ll meet up at lunch or something?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Maybe,&quot; you say, &lt;&lt;if $likes_boys gt 0&gt;&gt;determined not to turn pink.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;trying to sound non-committal.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;&lt;elseif $friends.includes(&quot;Justin&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You run into Justin during your very first week in junior high. He&#39;s taller than you remember, &lt;&lt;if $likes_boys gt 0&gt;&gt;and is starting to turn into a handsome young man. His shoulders are big and strong, and his face looks more manly, too.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;and is starting to look more like a man and less like a spindly little boy. His shoulders are filling out, and his jawline is more pronounced.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh, wow, look at you!&quot; Justin says, amazed and impressed. &quot;You look really good! I mean, I . . . I haven&#39;t seen you in so long.&quot; He tries to backtrack from his compliment, suddenly unsure of himself.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $likes_boys gt 0&gt;&gt;&quot;You too,&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&quot;Thanks,&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; you say. &quot;I think we last met maybe in fourth grade?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yeah,&quot; Justin says, thinking back. Delicately, he asks, &quot;So you&#39;ve been at a girls&#39; school. How was that?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;It was weird,&quot; you admit to him. &quot;I mean, I still don&#39;t feel like much of a girl.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Right,&quot; he says, nodding and appraising you carefully. &quot;//Right.// Because of the . . . time travelers?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;He&#39;s trying to sound friendly about it, like he&#39;s sharing some inside joke with you, but you can tell he has his doubts. Justin would probably be happy if you just told him it was all a childish fantasy. But that&#39;s not the truth. Carefully, you say, &quot;That&#39;s right. We can talk more about it. A lot has been going on.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh, I&#39;m //sure//,&quot; he says in vigorous agreement. Looking for a way out, he adds, &quot;Well, hey, I have to go to class, so . . .&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;&lt;elseif $friends.includes(&quot;Russell&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You run into Russell during your first week in junior high. He&#39;s starting to get really tall and thin, and his hair has become really long over the summer. &lt;&lt;if $likes_boys gt 0&gt;&gt;He&#39;s kind of cute, though, in a nerdy kind of way.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;A lot of girls think he&#39;s cute, though, in a nerdy kind of way.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Hi, Allie,&quot; Russell says to you quietly, speaking as though you had never been separated. &quot;Did you have a good summer?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yeah,&quot; you say, even though this was the Summer of Boobs and all the embarrassment that went along with that. Russell didn&#39;t need to hear about your breast troubles.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;You look pretty,&quot; he goes on, apparently not sure what else to say. &quot;You didn&#39;t used to have long hair. It&#39;s nice.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Thanks.&quot; He seems to be having a harder time talking to you than you are having talking to him, so that&#39;s a change. You seem to make Russell nervous. &quot;I grew it out the last year.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;It&#39;s . . . nice,&quot; he says, and having run out of things to say, he looks down at his feet and says, &quot;Well, I&#39;ll see you,&quot; and walks away quickly.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Of course, Tina and Val &lt;&lt;if $path.includes(&quot;exchange option&quot;)&gt;&gt;haven&#39;t seen you in forever and they &lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;have to know which boy you were talking to, so they drag you into the girls&#39; bathroom to find out who he is. You&#39;re still amazed at all the changes, too surprised to speak. &lt;&lt;if $path.includes(&quot;exchange option&quot;)&gt;&gt;First, you have to squeal with joy at the sight of your friends, whom you haven&#39;t seen in a whole year, and then there&#39;s the fact that&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;First, there&#39;s the idea that there&#39;s a bathroom you can hide in -- at Oakbrook, the bathrooms were no refuge at all --and then there&#39;s the fact that over the summer&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; Tina has grown super tall and is starting to get hips, and that Val has bigger boobs than anybody else in class you&#39;ve seen so far and dyed her hair blond over the summer. You have no time to gawk, because Val has already started to grill you about the mysterious boy.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;if $path.includes(&quot;exchange option&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh my God, it&#39;s been forever!&quot; Val says excitedly. &quot;How was France? Where were you? Tell me all about it!&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh, it was amazing!&quot; you say. &quot;There&#39;s just so much, though. I&#39;ll have to show you my pictures.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Not right now,&quot; she says. &quot;I have to ask you something first.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yeah?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Who //was// that boy?&quot; Val demanded. &quot;Do you know him? What&#39;s his name?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;He went to my old school at South Stevens,&quot; you try to explain, but they&#39;re already on to the next question.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;What did he say?&quot; Val asks. &quot;What were you guys talking about?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;He&#39;s probably got a girlfriend,&quot; Tina says gloomily.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Probably not,&quot; Val says, &quot;or he wouldn&#39;t have been talking to her.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Then he was cheating on his girlfriend,&quot; Tina declares, pursing her lips. &quot;That&#39;s probably it.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;It was nothing,&quot; you say. &quot;Just hello, haven&#39;t seen you in a while. That kind of thing.&quot;&lt;&lt;if $friends.includes(&quot;Justin&quot;)&gt;&gt; You&#39;re not prepared to tell Tina and Val about your secret conversation with Justin about traveling from the future.&lt;&lt;elseif $friends.includes(&quot;Tommy&quot;)&gt;&gt; It&#39;s not the right time to explain to Tina and Val how you once beat up Tommy in the third grade.&lt;&lt;elseif $friends.includes(&quot;Russell&quot;)&gt;&gt; You&#39;re not sure how to explain to Tina and Val how you know Russell -- friends for twenty years in a different future, but not much besides that.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Did he seem nice?&quot; Val asks, and without waiting for the answer to that question, asks three more. &quot;Did he say anything else? Is he in Block C with us? &lt;&lt;if $this_year lt 1990&gt;&gt;Did you get his number?&lt;&lt;elseif $this_year lt 2000&gt;&gt;Did you get his email?&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;Did you get his cell number?&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; Ahh!&quot; She growls at herself. &quot;I should have been closer. I couldn&#39;t hear. Next time you see him, I&#39;ll be standing closer. But not super close, just so I can hear him.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Okay,&quot; you say, not sure whether you need this much assistance to talk to a boy. The offer of help is comforting, but it&#39;s all happening so fast.&lt;/div&gt;

Well, not actually //talking// about it, but //wanting// to. Sort of hinting at it, more like. Talking about which boys are cutest, which girls have the best outfits, which are the best-looking movie stars, what kind of tips and tricks you can do with your clothes and makeup to get a boyfriend.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;No, that&#39;s not the trouble. The //real// trouble is that it&#39;s hard to remember that you&#39;re not really here for any of this girly stuff.

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $int == $cha and $int gte $str&gt;&gt;On the other hand, you&#39;re learning a ton about clothes and makeup, which is definitely going to come in handy.

Sure, as long as you&#39;re stuck in the past like this, it makes sense to try to fit in and everything, but looking pretty shouldn&#39;t be that important. It really shouldn&#39;t, you keep telling yourself.&lt;&lt;elseif $cha gt $int and $cha gte $str&gt;&gt;On the plus side, you&#39;re learning a ton of cool things about clothes and makeup, which definitely comes in handy.

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;But maybe the //real// real problem with being a young teenage girl is all the raging hormones taking over your brain. Maybe people //aren&#39;t// talking about sex, you just think they are, because your brain won&#39;t stop obsessing over it.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Of course, you&#39;re not at school just to talk about cute boys. There are classes as well. On the first day, your homeroom teacher explains to the class in his pinched, nasally voice that your academic choices will shape the rest of your life. Coach Ford is a large, balding man with a mustache, and you remember him primarily as a football coach who was given a job teaching history on the basis that he could do less damage to students that way. He puts his hands over his enormous belly and addresses the class through a regular punctuation of snuffles and snorts, the legacy of many broken noses received in a lifetime of playing sports. &quot;Everybody,&quot; he begins, and sniffs -- //knhh// -- &quot;should remember that you&#39;re here in school //knhh// to make something of yourself. //knhh// You&#39;re here to get //knhh// an education. So everybody in my homeroom class has to sign up for at least one //knhh// extracurricular event.&quot; Coach Ford picks up a clipboard in a big meaty hand and looks expectantly at the class, who is trying not to snicker at the sound of the big man&#39;s sniffling nose.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Most of the girls on the committee considered themselves popular, social, involved, and deeply important in the social fabric of Adams Junior High. They loved to participate in the organizing of the social calendar for the other kids in the school, and considered themselves essential to that process. Naturally that meant there was a fair amount of arguing -- sweet-tempered, smiling-daggers kind of arguing -- going on at most of the meetings, where the girls&#39; egos asserted themselves. There was even more arguing going on //after// the meetings, and //between// meetings, and this kind of arguing was of the knives-in-the-back variety: looking for allies, breaking up alliances, spreading rumors, and trying to swing the votes a different way. The smallest detail of the most insignificant event was a point of contention: the color of paper to be used for the signs, the way the napkins would be folded, the first song to be played.&lt;&lt;if $this_year gt 1995&gt;&gt; The two gay guys on the committee were divided between staying out of the girls&#39; way while the decisions were being hashed out, and being cattier than all of them put together, depending on the topic under debate.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $cha lt 9&gt;&gt;You&#39;re not very adept at all of this social maneuvering yet, so you mostly get caught in the middle, tugged this way and that by the stronger personalities on the committee.&lt;&lt;elseif $cha lt 11&gt;&gt;You have your hands full keeping on good terms with the strong personalities on the committee, as all sides of every argument come to you, hoping to sway you to their point of view.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;As one of the stronger personalities on the committee, you often find yourself in the middle of a battle for your affections, as all sides of every argument plead their case, begging you to lend your support.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; You can&#39;t escape them in the halls, between classes, or at lunch.

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Holly returns a smile, which disappears as she sees a familiar figure crossing the locker room toward the showers: Leigh Lucas, wearing only a towel. &quot;Oh, ugh,&quot; Holly says, turning away from Leigh and lowering her voice still further. &quot;Look at her.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You glance over toward Leigh, who is standing in the big, pink-tiled communal shower area as casually as if she were enjoying a private shower at home. There doesn&#39;t seem to be anything wrong, except Leigh is showing off her body //again//, which she does all the time anyway.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yes, you have boobs,&quot; Holly mutters. &quot;We don&#39;t all have to //see// them.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You look around you in shock, seeing the space for the first time, as if you hadn&#39;t already been using it for weeks. You&#39;re a girl. In the girls&#39; locker room. It&#39;s like discovering that you were suddenly a secret agent, and yet the mission isn&#39;t as interesting as you thought it would be. Sure, there are girls undressing, washing their hair, changing into street clothes, putting on makeup and deodorant. It&#39;s just like yesterday, and the day before.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;But it&#39;s all different somehow. &lt;&lt;if $likes_boys gt $likes_girls&gt;&gt;There are girls, and it&#39;s a locker room, but it doesn&#39;t excite you the way you thought it would.

Being in the girls&#39; locker room. Other girls dressing and undressing. Developing breasts, and other girls getting jealous of them. Is this what you signed up for?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Apparently it was. You stare off into space at nothing for a moment, shocked and surprised at how much your life has altered since you were thrown back into the past and stuff. It&#39;s all just so weird!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Carrie Larsen, the red-headed girl with braces, sees your look of stunned confusion and mistakes it for something else. &lt;&lt;if $boobs == 3&gt;&gt;&quot;It&#39;s not you,&quot; she says hurriedly, reaching out to touch your arm in sympathy. &quot;You&#39;ve got boobs too, but you&#39;re not always showing them off to everyone like //someone// I could mention.&quot;&lt;&lt;elseif $boobs == 2&gt;&gt;&quot;It&#39;s not you,&quot; she says hurriedly, reaching out to touch your arm in sympathy. &quot;You&#39;re starting to get boobs too, but it&#39;s not like you&#39;re always showing them off or anything.&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&quot;It&#39;s not you,&quot; she says hurriedly, reaching out to touch your arm in sympathy. &quot;I mean, you&#39;ll probably get boobs eventually, and me too. My mom says I&#39;m just a late bloomer, not like //some people// I could mention.&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; She throws a dark look in Leigh&#39;s direction.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I&#39;m pretty happy that mine aren&#39;t too big yet,&quot; Holly says, as she buttons her blouse over her A-cup bra. &quot;I mean, look at the way all the boys stare at girls like Leigh.

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;The leaves change in the fall. All the girls at Adams Junior High start talking about the Fall Formal, wondering who&#39;s going to ask who to the dance. Mostly the boys just shuffle around nervously, wondering who&#39;s supposed to make the first move -- they look anxious, and it makes your heart hurt to see how adorably scared they are of you. You used to be one of them once, too, remember?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;display &quot;Adams Junior High Christmas&quot;&gt;&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="67" name="Adams Junior High Honors 2" tags="" position="2550,1100" size="100,100">&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Morgan Saito, a half-Japanese girl with an impressive smile and a still-more impressive school record, takes you under her wing. She&#39;s been doing volunteer work since her days in the Girl Scouts, and it shows. Morgan is outgoing, dedicated, forthright, and charming. It&#39;s almost enough to make you annoyed with her, except she&#39;s //such// a nice person, and she turns out to be an amazing friend.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;As it turns out, Morgan also teaches you a lot about presenting yourself in a ladylike manner. She&#39;s an expert at styling and braiding her own hair, she knows all about makeup, she&#39;s got amazing taste in clothes and shoes, and best of all, the two of you are almost exactly the same size.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;If you ever need this blue sweater,&quot; she tells you one day, as her mother drives the two of you to the wildlife refuge, &quot;just ask. I have two. It was sort of on accident--&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;You put it on two different Christmas lists, honey,&quot; says her mother from the front seat of the van.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;--but anyway, you can borrow one if you need to,&quot; Morgan concludes. &quot;I&#39;ll bring one in for you. Not this one, the one with pockets. I don&#39;t like the pockets on the other one.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;You should have said, honey. I&#39;m not a mind reader.&quot;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Later, when the two of you are in the restroom near the entrance to the wildlife refuge, Morgan helps you with your makeup. It&#39;s a little more private in this echoing, rattling lavatory, where every dripping faucet echoes metallically around the room like a slap across the face. &quot;You&#39;re starting to get boobs,&quot; Morgan comments conversationally, looking through her stylish black handbag. &quot;You should probably ask your mom if you can get some different tops. Not so baggy. I think you&#39;d look better.&quot; She makes a face, and adds in an apologetic tone. &quot;The baggy shirts make you look fatter. I&#39;m sorry, but they kind of do.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I know,&quot; you admit, screwing off the lid to your mascara. &quot;But I didn&#39;t really want them to show. My mom, you know . . .&quot; You trail off.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;She was excited? Mine is. She can&#39;t wait for me to start getting boobs. I don&#39;t know, I&#39;m not so sure about it. Some days I&#39;m excited, and other days I just don&#39;t want it to happen yet. Are you okay?&quot; Morgan asks, looking at you. You haven&#39;t moved.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;//It&#39;s so normal,// you think. //I&#39;m in the girls&#39; bathroom, putting on makeup and talking about boobs. How do I keep forgetting that I&#39;m not supposed to be here?//&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Are you okay?&quot; Morgan says again, worried.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh, fine,&quot; you say weakly. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, what were you asking me?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Do you like your boobs?&quot; she asks. &quot;I&#39;m sorry if that&#39;s a weird question. &lt;&lt;if $boobs == 3&gt;&gt;It&#39;s just that yours are nice, and I don&#39;t know who else to ask.&lt;&lt;elseif $boobs == 2&gt;&gt;Yours are starting to come in, and I&#39;m too embarrassed to ask anyone else.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;I mean, yeah, yours are only just starting to come in, but I don&#39;t know who else to ask.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; It&#39;s like, sure, I have //friends,// but I don&#39;t think I can ask them something like //this.//&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

You vaguely remember Brett as one of those guys who was always //doing// stuff in junior high and high school -- singing and acting and whatnot, which you never paid much attention to. Now, of course, he&#39;s exactly the kind of person you&#39;re trying to be: a person who //does// stuff. And naturally, Brett is sly and witty and //gorgeous// and, &lt;&lt;if $year gt 2005&gt;&gt;unfortunately for you, also gay.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;maybe now that you think about it, probably gay.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; Kaitlin is almost exactly like him, in the way that she&#39;s sassy and flirty with absolutely everyone, except she&#39;s more of a dancer and a singer than an actress. She&#39;s in the choir, she plays piano, and she is always touching you, giving you little hugs and winks. But she does that to everybody, so it&#39;s okay.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;One day after the meeting, you&#39;re in the girls&#39; bathroom nearest to the baseball field. Casey wants to show you a new sweater her mom just bought her at a back-to-school sale. &quot;You&#39;ll love it,&quot; she promises you, stripping off her long-sleeved cotton shirt. As she undresses, she calls out to Brett, who is waiting outside. &quot;Brett, you want me to show you, too? It&#39;s the sweater I&#39;m going to wear to get a date for the Fall Formal.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;A fashion show? Oh, I&#39;m //in//,&quot; Brett says from outside the door, a sardonic little lilt to his voice. &quot;Is this the pink one you were telling me about?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Uh huh,&quot; Casey nods, fishing the sweater out of her bookbag. &quot;It&#39;s too hot to wear right now, but it&#39;ll be perfect for later this year.&quot; She stops, standing with the sweater in her hands, bra exposed, as she notices Brett has come into the girls&#39; bathroom. &quot;What are you doing?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;It&#39;s //fine//,&quot; Brett says breezily, with barely a glance at Casey&#39;s exposed flesh. &quot;I&#39;ve seen bras before. You change. I&#39;m just here for the catwalk performance. We&#39;re fine as long as nobody comes in.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Casey shrugs and finishes putting on the pink sweater, turning to show the two of you. &quot;What do you think? I think it makes my boobs look good.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh, definitely,&quot; Brett says, inspecting her attire. &quot;And it&#39;s definitely the right shade of pink for you, not too bright. I bet it would look good on Allie, too -- you practically have the same skin and hair color. &lt;&lt;if $boobs == 3&gt;&gt;If it makes //your// boobs look big, it&#39;ll make hers look dynamite.&lt;&lt;elseif $boobs == 2&gt;&gt;Your boobs are about the same size, as well.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;Her boobs need more help than yours do.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; Try it on.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You&#39;re already taking off your blouse -- Brett is gay, he doesn&#39;t count, it&#39;s safe -- when suddenly a wave of disorienting strangeness washes over you. You&#39;re trying on your friend Casey&#39;s sweater, a girl&#39;s sweater, in the girl&#39;s bathroom.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yes, it looks really good on you,&quot; Casey says, and in your preoccupied state, it sounds like she&#39;s speaking from far away. &quot;That pink really works with your skin and your hair. I like it. You should get one too.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $boobs == 3&gt;&gt;&quot;And check out her boobs. What did I tell you? Dynamite.&quot;&lt;&lt;elseif $boobs == 2&gt;&gt;&quot;Yes, fantastic. And about the same size boobs as you.&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&quot;Oh yes, that&#39;s what Allie needed. It really makes those boobs stand out.&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; Brett looks satisfied. &quot;If //I// had boobs, I&#39;d be set. I could get //anybody// to take me to the dance. You two are so lucky. What&#39;s it like, having breasts? I see other guys looking at them all the time. Is it weird?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I like it,&quot; Casey says, taking her sweater back from you and stowing it in her backpack. She has already replaced her cotton shirt. &quot;They&#39;re not big, but they&#39;ll do. They might get bigger some day, mom said. How about you, Allie?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Your two best friends on the committee are Dana Griffin and a girl everybody calls Casey, or K.C., because her real name is Kaitlin Clark. You remember Dana as one of those girls who was always //doing// stuff in junior high and high school -- orchestra, theater, cheerleading, and whatnot, which you never paid much attention to. Now, of course, she&#39;s exactly the kind of person you&#39;re trying to be: a person who //does// stuff. Naturally, she&#39;s also pretty and bright, with good grades and a wicked sense of humor. Kaitlin is almost exactly like her, in the way that she&#39;s sassy and flirty with absolutely everyone, except she&#39;s more of a dancer and a singer than an actress. She&#39;s in the choir, she plays piano, and she is always touching you, giving you little hugs and winks. But she does that to everybody, so it&#39;s okay. Also, Kaitlin is kind of flat, while Dana has even bigger boobs than Valerie Weaver.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;One day after the meeting, you&#39;re in the girls&#39; bathroom nearest to the baseball field. Casey wants to show you and Dana a new sweater her mom just bought her at a back-to-school sale. &quot;You&#39;ll love it,&quot; she promises you, stripping off her long-sleeved cotton shirt. &quot;It&#39;s the sweater I&#39;m going to wear to get a date for the Fall Formal.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;The pink one?&quot; Dana asks. &quot;You were telling me about a new pink sweater.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Uh huh,&quot; Casey nods, fishing the sweater out of her bookbag. &quot;It&#39;s too hot to wear right now, but it&#39;ll be perfect for later this year.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;You can&#39;t have //enough// pink,&quot; Dana says sagely. &quot;I wear it like //all// the time.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Casey slips on the pink sweater, turning to show the two of you as she tugs it into place. &quot;What do you think? I think it makes my boobs look good.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Dana examines the effect, her brow creasing as she evaluates the fit. &quot;I like it,&quot; she says at last. &quot;That&#39;s a good shade of pink for you -- a little dusty, not like super hot pink. It works with your skin. And Allie&#39;s too, probably. &lt;&lt;if $boobs == 3&gt;&gt;It might look better on her, because her boobs are a bit bigger than yours.&lt;&lt;elseif $boobs == 2&gt;&gt;It&#39;ll probably fit the same, because you two wear the same bra size.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;Her boobs aren&#39;t as big, but it&#39;ll still look good.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; Try it on.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You&#39;re already taking off your blouse when suddenly a wave of disorienting strangeness washes over you. You&#39;re trying on your friend Casey&#39;s sweater, a girl&#39;s sweater, in the girl&#39;s bathroom.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yep, I thought so,&quot; Dana says with satisfaction. &quot;You two should share clothes more often. You&#39;re practically the same size, and you can wear the same colors and everything. I wish //I// had somebody who was the same size as me, but nobody has boobs like //these.//&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Well, you //have// some,&quot; Casey says primly. &quot;It&#39;s easy for //you// to complain.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I guess that&#39;s true,&quot; Dana says. &quot;I still don&#39;t really like it, though. They&#39;re just too big.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I like mine,&quot; Casey says, taking her sweater back from you and stowing it in her backpack. She has already replaced her cotton shirt. &quot;They&#39;re not big, but they&#39;ll do. They might get bigger some day, Mom said. How about you, Allie?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Of course, with the school year under way, the autumn months were starting to slip past pretty quickly, and all your girlfriends were buzzing with anticipation over the junior homecoming dance. &lt;&lt;if $path.includes(&quot;dance committee&quot;)&gt;&gt;Since you&#39;re on the dance committee, they&#39;re constantly asking you for information about it: the theme, the colors, the music, and everything else.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;You can&#39;t quite recall whether you ever attended a 7th grade dance before, but considering that you were a boy the last time you attended junior high, you probably hadn&#39;t been paying attention.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; Most of the boys seem pretty clueless that there&#39;s even such a thing happening at all, despite the colorful posters that &lt;&lt;if $path.includes(&quot;dance committee&quot;)&gt;&gt;you and the committee&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;have been&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; put up all over the place.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;if $friends.includes(&quot;Angelica&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Of course, this leads to some inevitable drama in the girls&#39; bathroom during lunch as you gather to discuss your dance prospects.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Have you been asked yet?&quot; Whitney asks you for about the millionth time since the posters went up. When you shake your head in the negative, she sighs with extra drama and a toss of her head. &quot;Ugh! Me neither. I&#39;m thinking about setting out some kind of trap. You know, a little box, held up by a stick, sitting in the hallway...&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;With a //Playboy// in it?&quot; Angelica asks brightly.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Whitney grunts again, pulling out some gloss and leaning forward into the mirror for a better look at her lips. &quot;Oh, please. I like men with simple tastes. I&#39;ll use a turkey sandwich. I always see Daniel eating a sandwich in the cafeteria.&quot; Daniel Cobb was Whitney&#39;s latest obsession.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;How about you, Jamie?&quot; Angelica asks, turning to the tall black girl. &quot;Any luck?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Not yet,&quot; she frets, with a look of unconcern. &quot;It&#39;s early. The posters just went up. I&#39;d give it a week before I start to worry.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Jacquelyn Kidd just rolls her eyes at all of you. &quot;They&#39;re never going to notice you. They&#39;re just //boys.// You&#39;ll have to drop hints if you want to go out with someone.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;That&#39;s easy for you to say,&quot; Whitney says nastily, turning to the Korean girl. &quot;You already have a date. What did you do, promise to let him kiss you?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;He&#39;s already done that,&quot; Jacquelyn says quietly, but not as if she is boasting. She seems a little uncomfortable. &quot;It was okay.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;To defuse some of the tension, Jamie turns to you. &quot;How about you, Allie? Has anyone asked you?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;&lt;elseif $friends.includes(&quot;Whitney&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $friends.includes(&quot;Jody&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Of course, this leads to some inevitable drama in the girls&#39; bathroom during lunch as you gather to discuss your dance prospects.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;You&#39;d need a hell of a big box,&quot; Jody Stafford says firmly, running a comb through her short, neck-length hair. She never likes to grow her hair out. &quot;But if it works, try and get me one too, would you?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Why hasn&#39;t Daniel //asked// me yet?&quot; Whitney frets. She always found a way to bring the conversation back to her latest obsession, a boy named Daniel Cobb.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Just relax,&quot; Jacquelyn Kidd says, rolling her eyes at all of you. &quot;They&#39;re just //boys.// Just drop some hints. That&#39;s what I did.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;That&#39;s not //all// you dropped,&quot; Whitney says nastily, turning on the Korean girl. &quot;Is that how you got Sean to ask you?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;We haven&#39;t done anything,&quot; Jacquelyn says quietly. &quot;We kissed a couple of times. It was okay.&quot; She seems uncomfortable with sharing so much.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yeah, I&#39;ve heard that about Sean,&quot; Jody says with a wicked little raise of her eyebrows. &quot;Say, Allie, you&#39;re pretty quiet.

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh, turkey?&quot; Kaitlin Clark asks, a mischievous glint in her eye as she primps her hair in the bathroom mirror. &quot;Breast or thigh?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh, //you,//&quot; says Jacquelyn Kidd with a wan smile flittng across her Asian features.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Come on, now,&quot; K.C. interjects, trying to keep the peace. &quot;You&#39;re a little worried because you haven&#39;t been asked. Don&#39;t take it out on Jacquie, she&#39;s your friend.&quot; She turns to you, obviously looking to change the focus of the conversation, and asks, &quot;How about you, Allie?

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Cool it, you two,&quot; Val says imperiously. &quot;Just stop it. You&#39;re getting on my tits.&quot; With a decisive and annoyed sigh, she turns to you. &quot;Any news, Allie?

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;If somebody asks me,&quot; Tara says, tapping the bat on home plate a few times, &quot;I&#39;ll probably go. I dunno.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Me too,&quot; Jody comments, tossing a ball underhand from the mound. Tara swings and manages to connect, but the ball tips off the bat and into the chain-link backstop behind her, and you go retrieve it.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I mean, I wouldn&#39;t say //no,// probably,&quot; Tara muses. She takes a practice swing while you return the ball to Jody.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Why //would// you?&quot; Jody asks. &quot;Don&#39;t you like boys?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Of //course// I like boys,&quot; Tara says, a little heatedly. &quot;Why wouldn&#39;t I like boys?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Jody shrugs and delivers another underhand pitch. &quot;I don&#39;t know. You didn&#39;t seem interested in going, that&#39;s all.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Maybe she doesn&#39;t like //dances,//&quot; you suggest.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Tara points the bat at you, acknowledging your point. &quot;Yeah. That right there. I don&#39;t like dances. I&#39;m not a frilly dress kind of girl.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;A couple of pitches pass between them. Tara connects on a couple of them, sending them to the edge of the outfield grass.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;How about you, Allie? Would you go, if a boy asked you?&quot; Tara asks. &quot;//Has// a boy asked you?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;&lt;elseif $friends.includes(&quot;Tara&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $friends.includes(&quot;Brooke&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Of course, this leads to some inevitable drama during lunch as you gather after school outside near the baseball field to discuss your dance prospects.

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Has someone asked you, then?&quot; asks Brooke Harding from the mound. She stretches and tosses a ball underhand to the plate. Tara swings and manages to connect, but the ball tips off the bat and into the chain-link backstop behind her, and you go retrieve it.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;No, not yet,&quot; Tara says. She takes a practice swing while you return the ball to Brooke. &quot;I&#39;m just saying I wouldn&#39;t say no.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I wouldn&#39;t either,&quot; Brooke says. &quot;You have to get a boy to ask you first, though.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Boys are stupid,&quot; Tara says, a little heatedly. &quot;I&#39;m not even sure I //want// one to ask me.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Brooke prepares to deliver another pitch. &lt;&lt;if $this_year lt 2005&gt;&gt;&quot;I don&#39;t think they&#39;d let you go with a girl.&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&quot;I don&#39;t know if they&#39;d let you ask another girl. Maybe.&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;It&#39;s not that,&quot; Tara says. It comes out a little more loudly than she probably meant it. &quot;I just don&#39;t know if I&#39;d go, that&#39;s all.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Maybe she doesn&#39;t like //dances,//&quot; you suggest.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh, you&#39;d say no, would you?&quot; Holly Romero calls over, just a trace of ironic disbelief in her voice. Holly is standing out near first base with a baseball glove, hands on knees, ready to catch anything that comes her way.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I might, yeah,&quot; Tara says. She takes a practice swing while you return the ball to Carrie Larson, the redhead on the mound. &quot;You know. Depends on the boy.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I&#39;d go,&quot; Carrie offers. She turns the ball over in her hand, looking for the right set of seams. &quot;Not that any boy ever asked or anything.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;That&#39;s because they&#39;re stupid,&quot; Tara says, a little heatedly. &quot;I&#39;m not even sure I //want// one to ask me.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;So why don&#39;t you ask a boy yourself?&quot; Holly calls from first base. &quot;I would.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;It&#39;s not that,&quot; Tara says. It comes out a little more loudly than she probably meant it. &quot;I just don&#39;t know if I&#39;d go, that&#39;s all.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;You can say that again!&quot; Holly laughs.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;A couple of pitches pass between them. Tara connects on a couple of them, sending them to the edge of the outfield grass. Holly goes chasing after them.&lt;/div&gt;

You&#39;d need to put me in chains!&quot; Tara swings and manages to connect, but the ball tips off the bat and into the chain-link backstop behind her, and you go retrieve it.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I mean, I wouldn&#39;t say //no,// probably,&quot; Tara muses. She takes a practice swing while you return the ball to Val.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;What, are you crazy?&quot; Val says. &quot;Why would you want to miss a dance?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

Today&#39;s lunch is turkey with green beans, not the most appetizing of the school cafeteria&#39;s offerings.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;The dance?&quot; Courtney asks, frowning as she tries to open a carton of juice. &quot;I don&#39;t know. I think probably nobody&#39;s going to ask me to that. It&#39;s probably for the best, anyway.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Somebody&#39;s going to ask you,&quot; Brooke tells her friend loyally. &quot;And if nobody does, then we&#39;ll go together. How does that sound?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;It -- oh,&quot; Courtney says. After some struggle, she finally opens her juice, but the carton tears open too widely and splashes some fruit chemical mixture into her green beans. She looks down at the toxic mixture, seemingly close to tears. &quot;Oh, great. See that? That&#39;s me all over. I&#39;m the juice in the green beans. I don&#39;t belong at the dance.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Cour, don&#39;t say things like that,&quot; Brooke protests, handing her some napkins. &quot;You&#39;re smart, you&#39;re cute. Somebody&#39;s going to ask you. Isn&#39;t that right, Allie?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; you say. &quot;I guess it could happen.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;There, you see?&quot; Brooke says, while shooting you a look that says //she&#39;s your friend, be more encouraging.// &quot;Allie thinks somebody will ask us. That&#39;s good, right?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Courtney looks down at her cafeteria tray. &quot;Yeah.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Here, let me get that,&quot; Morgan says, taking the juice from her. &quot;I know a trick, watch.&quot; She puts a thumbnail into the carton, loosening the flaps, and opens it easily. &quot;There you go.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Thanks,&quot; Courtney says. &quot;I always spill when I open those things.&quot; She takes a sip of packaged fruit juice and makes a face. In a somewhat brittle voice, she says, &quot;Oh, I&#39;d like to go, no doubt. I just don&#39;t think it&#39;s going to happen, that&#39;s all. I&#39;m okay with that.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;It&#39;s okay to want to go,&quot; Morgan assures her. The Japanese girl puts her arm around Courtney&#39;s back. &quot;That&#39;s what my mom always says. When you want something, you work a little harder for it, and that&#39;s always a good thing.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;But I can&#39;t,&quot; Courtney says, with a little sniffle. &quot;Nobody notices me. I&#39;m just the smart girl who likes to read.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;If they don&#39;t notice you,&quot; Morgan says, &quot;then you don&#39;t want them anyway. Right, Allie?&quot;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Sure,&quot; you say, taking Morgan&#39;s lead. Obviously she wants you to say yes.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Courtney looks down at her cafeteria tray. &quot;Okay, I suppose.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;That&#39;s the way!&quot; Morgan says encouragingly, side-hugging Courtney again. &quot;There&#39;s always hope. Even Allie says so. I bet she&#39;s going too.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;&lt;elseif $friends.includes(&quot;Kaitlin&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Of course, this leads to some inevitable drama at your cafeteria table during lunch as you gather to discuss your dance prospects.

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh, fish farts!&quot; laughs Kaitlin Clark, also known as Casey. &quot;That&#39;s not true at all.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Fish farts!&quot; Courtney repeats, breaking into peals of laughter. &quot;//What?//&quot; A couple of boys from a nearby table look sullenly over to see what you girls are laughing at, in case it might be them.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;You&#39;re going and that&#39;s that,&quot; Casey insists. Drawing herself up as if to make a grand proclamation, she says, &quot;You&#39;ll go if I have to take you myself!&quot; She deflates a little and leans closer to whisper something in Courtney&#39;s ear. &quot;I&#39;ll wear a mustache. They&#39;ll never know. What color dress are you going to wear?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Courtney dissolves into helpless, nervous giggles. The sullen boys at the next table shoot her dirty looks.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Thanks, I needed that,&quot; Courtney says, wiping tears from her eyes. &quot;I don&#39;t know why it matters so much. It&#39;s silly. It&#39;s just a //dance.//&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Dances are //not// silly,&quot; Casey says, putting on an overly dramatic adult-sounding voice. &quot;I happen to be on the committee, you impertinent little girl. Show some respect!&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Courtney laughs again. &quot;You are so wonderful. Thanks for cheering me up.&quot; She looks around at you and Courtney, and asks, &quot;So, has anybody asked either of you?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Of course, this leads to some inevitable drama at your cafeteria table during lunch as you gather to discuss your dance prospects. Today&#39;s lunch is turkey with green beans, not the most appetizing of the school cafeteria&#39;s offerings.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;The dance?&quot; Courtney asks, frowning as she tries to open a carton of juice. &quot;I don&#39;t know. I think probably nobody&#39;s going to ask me to that. It&#39;s probably for the best, anyway.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Not going to a dance is //never// for the best,&quot; Val says firmly.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;You&#39;re going to spill,&quot; Tina Matthews predicts gloomily. &quot;I always tear those stupid cartons when I open them. It gets all over.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Courtney frowns at her juice carton and tries again from the other side. From this angle it opens easily.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Well, //I// always spill,&quot; Tina sighs.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;You&#39;re going to go,&quot; Val declares. &quot;We&#39;ll make a pact, okay? If one of us gets a date, then we&#39;ll make sure the other girls do too. How does that sound?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Unless Allie already //has// a date,&quot; Tina says.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;No, she doesn&#39;t,&quot; Val says, but then in a less certain voice, she asks, &quot;Do you?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;

/%
On a basic level, the logic goes like this:
	Allie always has a Best Score, representing her body type.
	For the sake of coding, Balanced always has a Best Score of CHA.
	
	Allie can always take a skill that grants the Best Score as its
	primary (ie, larger) bonus;	in the case of a +3/+1 skill the Best
	Skill is the +3 part.
	
	Allie can always take a skill that grants something other than the
	best score, IF it grants fewer points than the margin by which Best
	Score leads. That is, if CHA is 3 points ahead,	Allie can always
	take a skill that grants +1 +2 or +3 STR/INT. If the margin is 0 or
	less (Best Score is tied or behind), Allie cannot take the skill
	using this rule.
	
	Allie can always take a skill that grants something other than the
	best score, IF the amount it grants can be offset by another later
	choice toward the Best Score. That is, if Allie is balanced (margin
	is 0) and has Best Score of CHA, she can take an INT +3 skill as
	long as there is a CHA +3 skill yet to be chosen.
	
	It should always be the case (but I need to constantly be alert for
	it not being so) that the first choice of any cycle is a free
	choice; the player can always choose anything. This is because
	there are no times when the first choice outweighs all the later
	choices: every round, there are an equal number of points available
	for every skill. Even in the hypothetical extreme case where Choice
	#1 is worth 6 STR points, and there are 12 additional choices worth
	1 point for INT and CHA, the first choice need not be regulated.

The Oakbrook girls were merciless, mocking her for her chubby knees, her plump face, her unwashed hair, and her rumpled uniform.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;She had improved only a little since then. Jillian had grown taller but not wider, so she was starting to grow into her body weight. Her middle was still somewhat thick and burly, and she didn&#39;t have breasts yet, but at least her hair was washed, and her clothes were clean and pressed. Long skirt, dark heavy sweater, chunky black shoes. Not stylish, but presentable.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh, hi, Allie,&quot; she says to you, waving one of her chubby pink hands. &quot;You did well in class today.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I did?&quot; you ask. You don&#39;t remember having a class with her.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh, yes,&quot; Jillian says encouragingly. &quot;History class. You answered that current events question. You must read the newspaper //a lot.//&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You want to be able to tell her, //No, not really. For me, this is all history.// But you say, &quot;Oh, I probably heard it somewhere.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;You should be proud, that was a hard question,&quot; Jillian says shyly, then adds, &quot;I read a lot too.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;That you do remember about her. All the teasing drove Jillian into the library, where she read everything on the shelves. Wait, is Jillian trying to be friends with you? //Nobody// is friends with Jillian except for loners and losers and stuff. What if people find out?&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Who are you going with?&quot; you ask.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;He reflects upon the notion briefly. &quot;Nobody, really.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;You should go!&quot; you say encouragingly. &quot;I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll be a lot of fun.!&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I know!&quot; he says excitedly. &quot;I&#39;ve been //so// busy with school. I mean, you know, you&#39;re in school too, but there&#39;s so much homework. Do you get a lot of homework?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh yeah, man, I wish,&quot; Justin says. &quot;I just don&#39;t have much time to go do anything fun. Isn&#39;t that weird? I mean, when we were kids way back when, we used to be able to play all the time.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;You don&#39;t get to do //anything// fun?&quot; you ask, trying to push Justin&#39;s scattered, skittering thoughts in the direction of the school dance. &quot;What about the dance that&#39;s coming up?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I don&#39;t know, //dances//?&quot; he asks, making a face. &quot;That doesn&#39;t sound like that much fun.

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;//Somebody __cute__?// you think angrily. //What&#39;s wrong with asking me?// Out loud, you say, &quot;What, I&#39;m not cute?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Thomas,&quot; he says, correcting you, but then he shrugs. &quot;Naw, you can call me Tommy. I like that.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;So, how have you been?&quot; you ask. &quot;Are you super busy with school?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Naw,&quot; he says dismissively. &quot;Been playing baseball. It&#39;s good, I guess. I prefer basketball, but baseball is okay too. Do you play sports?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $path.includes(&quot;volleyball&quot;)&gt;&gt;&quot;I played volleyball,&quot; you tell him,&lt;&lt;elseif $path.includes(&quot;gymnastics&quot;)&gt;&gt;&quot;I did gymnastics,&quot; you tell him,&lt;&lt;elseif $path.includes(&quot;swimming&quot;)&gt;&gt;&quot;I like to go swimming,&quot; you tell him,&lt;&lt;elseif $path.includes(&quot;horses&quot;)&gt;&gt;&quot;I&#39;m learning to ride horses,&quot; you tell him, fibbing a little,&lt;&lt;elseif $path.includes(&quot;bicycle&quot;)&gt;&gt;&quot;I like to ride my bike,&quot; you tell him,&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&quot;Oh, sure,&quot; you say, fibbing a little,&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; &quot;but what I really love to do is dance.&quot; Your heart pounding, you add, &quot;Do you like to dance?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Sure, I like to dance,&quot; Thomas says, bobbing his head as if to the sound of a heavy bass beat. &quot;Dancing is great.&quot; He demonstrates a few crude moves.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;You&#39;re good!&quot; you say, trying to sound encouraging, and trying not to giggle at his flailing dance maneuvers. It&#39;s cute the way he&#39;s showing off. &quot;So, are you going to ask anybody to the dance?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;What dance?&quot; he asks blankly.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;The one coming up,&quot; you say vaguely, feeling yourself losing steam. &quot;In the spring.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Naw, I&#39;ll probably be playing ball,&quot; he says with another shrug. &quot;Most likely. Unless I find a girl I could dance with.&quot; Tommy thinks for a moment, rubbing his nose, then looks back at you. &quot;Oh, yeah, I almost forgot. You&#39;re a girl. I could go with you.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Me, dance? Oh, I don&#39;t know,&quot; Justin says breezily. &quot;I have two left feet. Wouldn&#39;t that be weird, having two left feet? You&#39;d have to buy really weird shoes. Anyway, I don&#39;t have anybody to dance with, so I guess that&#39;s out.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;&lt;elseif $prospbf == &quot;Tommy&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;Oh, hi, Tommy,&quot; you say to him, as if you hadn&#39;t been following him for a week. &quot;There you are. I haven&#39;t seen you in a while.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Thomas,&quot; he says, correcting you, but then he shrugs. &quot;Naw, you can call me Tommy. I like that.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;So, how have you been?&quot; you ask. &quot;Are you super busy with school?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Naw,&quot; he says dismissively. &quot;Been playing baseball. It&#39;s good, I guess. I prefer basketball, but baseball is okay too. Do you play sports?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $path.includes(&quot;volleyball&quot;)&gt;&gt;&quot;I played volleyball,&quot; you tell him,&lt;&lt;elseif $path.includes(&quot;gymnastics&quot;)&gt;&gt;&quot;I did gymnastics,&quot; you tell him,&lt;&lt;elseif $path.includes(&quot;swimming&quot;)&gt;&gt;&quot;I like to go swimming,&quot; you tell him,&lt;&lt;elseif $path.includes(&quot;horses&quot;)&gt;&gt;&quot;I&#39;m learning to ride horses,&quot; you tell him, fibbing a little,&lt;&lt;elseif $path.includes(&quot;bicycle&quot;)&gt;&gt;&quot;I like to ride my bike,&quot; you tell him,&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&quot;Oh, sure,&quot; you say, fibbing a little,&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; &quot;but what I really love to do is dance.&quot; Your heart pounding, you add, &quot;Do you like to dance?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Sure, I like to dance,&quot; Thomas says, bobbing his head as if to the sound of a heavy bass beat. &quot;Dancing is great.&quot; He demonstrates a few crude moves.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;You&#39;re good!&quot; you say, trying to sound encouraging, and trying not to giggle at his flailing dance maneuvers. It&#39;s cute the way he&#39;s showing off. &quot;So, are you going to ask anybody to the dance?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;What dance?&quot; he asks blankly.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;The one coming up,&quot; you say vaguely, feeling yourself losing steam. &quot;In the spring.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Naw, I&#39;ll probably be playing ball,&quot; he says with another shrug. &quot;Most likely. Besides, I don&#39;t got anybody to dance with.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;//You don&#39;t?// you want to ask. //I&#39;m standing right here.// But he doesn&#39;t seem to see what you&#39;re asking, and standing around waiting for an invitation that never comes is just //too// embarrassing for words.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;That&#39;s too bad,&quot; he said, and he has the good grace to look dejected for you. &quot;Look, I was thinking, if you&#39;re not going, I don&#39;t have a date, and I&#39;d really like to go with you. Would that be okay?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I&#39;m //never// going to get to go to dances!&quot; you tell her, wailing in frustration. &quot;Never!&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Your father didn&#39;t ask me out the first time we met, either, sweetie,&quot; she reminds you, putting an arm around your slender shoulders. &quot;It&#39;s a little to soon to give up on going to dances.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;But he&#39;s never going to //ask// me,&quot; you say, wiping tears from your eyes. &quot;He&#39;s so mean.

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Boys take a little longer to mature,&quot; your mother says, still running a comforting warm hand up your back. &quot;Girls usually know what they want a lot sooner than boys. You&#39;ll just have to wait a couple of years before they catch up to you.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;A couple of //years?//&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

She drags you out shopping for a nice, modest dress that&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;practically loses her mind when she finds out you&#39;re going to a real school dance, and with an actual real-life //boy// no less. She hauls you off to the mall to go shopping for a nice girly dress that&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; suits your &lt;&lt;if $boobs == 4&gt;&gt;curvy figure without exposing too much up top.&lt;&lt;elseif $boobs == 3&gt;&gt;girlish figure without exposing anything on top.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;slender figure and accentuates the little you have up top.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; Then there are shoes to be found, a matching handbag to be purchased, and styling appointments to be made: hair, nails, facial, tanning, and all the rest.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;When the evening of the dance arrives, you find you can barely eat lunch, and you obsess nervously about fitting into your new dress. By this time every possible scenario has been gone over in great detail with your girlfriends, so there isn&#39;t much left to talk about except the dear hope that everything goes right.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Your mom insists on driving you and $prospbf to the dance, allowing you and $prospbf to sit in the back seat of the car, together, while she drives up front like a nosy chauffeur.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;if $prospbf == &quot;Russell&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh, you look so handsome,&quot; she tells Russell, and it&#39;s more or less true: Russell&#39;s parents have bought him a tuxedo with a tie and handkerchief set that matches your gown, and Russell has cleaned himself up considerably. He still looks introverted and withdrawn, uncertain about the prospects of the evening, but that just makes him look adorable.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;&lt;elseif $prospbf == &quot;Justin&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh, you look so handsome,&quot; she tells Justin, which is pretty close to the truth. Justin is wearing a dark suit and necktie which more or less matches your gown, and has come prepared with corsages for the two of you. Justin is all smiles and awkward jokes, but he seems genuinely happy to see you.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;&lt;elseif $prospbf == &quot;Tommy&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh, my, don&#39;t //you// look handsome,&quot; she tells Tommy, and she&#39;s right: he does. He has come wearing a rented tuxedo, tight across his brawny shoulders, and he looks rather dashing in it. Instead of matching your dress, his bowtie and pocket square are plain white, which is okay; at least it doesn&#39;t clash, and you can see how hard he&#39;s trying.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;The dance itself just like &lt;&lt;if $path.includes(&quot;dance committee&quot;)&gt;&gt;your committee had imagined it.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;you had imagined it.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; There are tables in the cafeteria for people to sit and talk, a DJ on the stage feeding music into the loudspeakers, and swirling lights around the darkened room. An enchanting twilight hangs over the dimly-lit room, allowing privacy for conversation -- but not too much, as the watchful eyes of the adult chaperones were everywhere. There were even some kids dancing.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;if $prospbf == &quot;Tommy&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Tommy is more interested in the punch bowl than the dance floor, but sooner or later he gets around to asking for your hand. You join him on the dance floor for a few songs, letting his clumsy but enthusiastic gyrating set the tone.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Finally, there&#39;s a slow song, and you and Tommy stand close together, with his big hands on your tiny waist, as you gently turn around the floor, your arms around his back, your head nestled on his chest. Tommy smells like Old Spice and fruit punch, but his touch is surprisingly gentle for a boy as outgoing and athletic as he. It&#39;s like he doesn&#39;t know what to do with you, now that he&#39;s got you in his arms.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Later, he finally figures it out on the way home. Just as your mom is holding open the rear car door to let Tommy out, he leans over to give you a quick kiss, then ducks his head and rushes out of the car. &quot;See you on Monday, Allie,&quot; he says.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;It is, without a doubt, the weirdest school dance you&#39;ve ever been to.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;elseif $prospbf == &quot;Russell&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;At first, Russell is too terrified and shy to speak, and seems to be listening to some inner dance coach -- his mother? -- telling him how to treat a lady on a first date. Immediately upon entering the room, he asks for your hand to dance, and bows, then realizes he did it in the wrong order and tries bowing first and then asking for your hand. He&#39;s nervous, but he&#39;s also determined to do it right.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Russell isn&#39;t much of a dancer when it comes to fast songs; he&#39;s much too shy about the way he looks and the way he moves. When it comes to slow dances, he&#39;s definitely had practice. He puts his left hand firmly on your right hip and takes your left hand in his other, leading in a very correct (if old-fashioned) ballroom step. From the intense look on his face, he&#39;s concentrating hard.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;At the very last dance, Russell takes your hand in his and kisses it gently. You can tell he&#39;s still nervous; his hands tremble. Nevertheless, he performs his miniature Asian Fred Astaire routine and dances with you one final time.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Unfortunately, Russell&#39;s mother is waiting among the chaperones and you don&#39;t get to ride home together. Under the watchful eyes of his mother and your own, there is no goodbye kiss. The last dance still lingers in your memory for the rest of the weekend.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;It is, without a doubt, the weirdest school dance you&#39;ve ever been to.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;elseif $prospbf == &quot;Justin&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;On arriving at the dance, Justin immediately makes the rounds with you, meeting everyone there, exchanging hellos, and finding out who came. He&#39;s very sociable, and his awkward jokes bring smiles to the faces of the other students in attendance. //He&#39;s showing me off,// you realize, as he takes you to visit another knot of boys and girls in the corner.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Only then is Justin prepared to dance. His moves on the dance floor are better than you would have guessed; his greatest asset is his total lack of inhibition. Justin doesn&#39;t mind looking foolish. He commits one hundred percent to dancing his silly head off, and you go along for the ride. He even gets compliments, which only encourages him further.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;He&#39;s not much for slow-dancing, but you teach him how to sway to the music. It only takes a few songs before he finally seems to understand, and you rock back and forth on your toes together on the dance floor.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;In between songs, you chat with Justin and whichever group of friends happens by. Justin gets along well with everyone. Finally, when the evening seems to be ending on a medley of fast-paced songs, he leads you to the dance floor again. At the end of the last dance, he pulls you tight to him, his strong arms drawing you close, and kisses you strongly on the lips. It&#39;s a good kiss -- you feel faint for a moment.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;The rest of the evening is a little awkward. You&#39;d like to talk a little more, to get to know this version of Justin a bit better, but he seems at a loss how to make meaningful, deep conversation with you. Still, he seems quite happy with himself, and with you, so you don&#39;t press him too hard for small talk.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;It is, without a doubt, the weirdest school dance you&#39;ve ever been to.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Later, as you&#39;re about to go to bed, you&#39;re reflecting on everything that&#39;s happened to you in the last four years -- almost //five// years now. A strange woman sent you hurtling backward in time to your own past to live your life over again as a girl, &lt;&lt;if $reaction == &quot;accept&quot;&gt;&gt;and you promised your parents you would try.&lt;&lt;elseif $reaction == &quot;resist&quot;&gt;&gt;and you didn&#39;t have much choice but to try.&lt;&lt;elseif $reaction == &quot;refuse&quot;&gt;&gt;but you couldn&#39;t imagine how to begin thinking of yourself that way.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; Now you&#39;ve been on a date. In a dress. In front of everybody.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Something on your mind, pumpkin?&quot; your mom asks, seeing the thoughtful look on your face. &quot;I hope you had a good time.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Still thinking of the dance, you reply...&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Your mom insists on driving you and $prospbf to the dance, allowing you and $prospbf to sit in the back seat of the car, together, while she drives up front like a nosy chauffeur.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh my, don&#39;t you look nice,&quot; your mom says to Curt, and of course he does; he looks //amazing.// He&#39;s got on a nice tuxedo with the proper matching bow tie and handkerchief, and he&#39;s even remembered to bring corsages. Curt cuts quite the handsome figure in that tight-fitting jacket. Somehow it makes him look taller and broader across the shoulder than he already is.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Curt takes you to the dance floor the very moment you arrive, hardly pausing to leave your handbag and your windbreaker at your mother&#39;s table. There on the dance floor he shows you what he can do -- and he really //can// dance.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh my God, Curt, where did you learn to dance like that?&quot; you exclaim happily. &lt;&lt;if $path.includes(&quot;dance&quot;)&gt;&gt;&quot;I took dance in school and I can barely keep up!&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&quot;I can&#39;t keep up with you!&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Four sisters,&quot; he says shortly, saving his breath, and he sends you into a twirl.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Eventually even you have to admit it&#39;s time to sit down, and you and Curt move around the room looking for friendly faces. &lt;&lt;if $path.includes(&quot;flirt Curt&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $friends.includes(&quot;Tara&quot;)&gt;&gt;Tara wasn&#39;t too happy to see you with Curt, that&#39;s for sure. When you tried to speak to her, she was pretty cold and aloof.&lt;&lt;elseif $friends.includes(&quot;Courtney&quot;)&gt;&gt;Courtney wasn&#39;t happy at all to see you with Curt. When you started to approach the table where she was sitting with her date, she grabbed his hand, stood up, and stalked away with the boy in tow behind her.&lt;&lt;elseif $friends.includes(&quot;Whitney&quot;)&gt;&gt;Whitney wasn&#39;t happy to see you with Curt, not at all. She kept giving you the stink-eye, glaring at you when her date wasn&#39;t looking, and Jacquelyn kept trying to give her little arm-squeezes of friendly reassurance. Meanwhile, Jacquelyn&#39;s date was off somewhere talking to one of the teachers.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $friends.includes(&quot;Tara&quot;)&gt;&gt;Tara seemed pretty happy to see you, even though you were with Curt.&lt;&lt;elseif $friends.includes(&quot;Courtney&quot;)&gt;&gt;Courtney was even polite to you, which wasn&#39;t a sure thing, given that you had arrived at the dance as Curt&#39;s date.&lt;&lt;elseif $friends.includes(&quot;Whitney&quot;)&gt;&gt;Whitney was civil to you, at least, even though she would rather have been Curt&#39;s date than the scrawny boy she finally ended up saying yes to. Jacquelyn looked as if she would rather have been Whitney&#39;s date; her young man was off talking to one of the teachers.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; It wasn&#39;t even your //fault// that Curt had asked you, which you supposed make everything okay.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;When the evening is over, Curt gives you a strong hug, enfolding you in his powerful arms, and you smell that wonderful intoxicating cologne of his. &quot;Allie?&quot; he asks you, his face very near yours. &quot;Would your mom over there mind if I gave you a kiss?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $reaction == &quot;accept&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;Probably,&quot; you say impishly, &quot;but you should do it anyway.&quot;&lt;&lt;elseif $reaction == &quot;resist&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;Maybe,&quot; you say, &quot;but I don&#39;t mind.&quot;&lt;&lt;elseif $reaction == &quot;refuse&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;I think so,&quot; you say. &quot;You probably shouldn&#39;t.&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;In that case, I will,&quot; Curt says in his deep voice, and he kisses you once on the lips.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;It is a kiss that stays with you for weeks after the dance, full of life and warmth and strength and just a hint of that wonderful cologne he wears. &lt;&lt;if $reaction == &quot;accept&quot;&gt;&gt;//Holy cow, now that was a kiss!//&lt;&lt;elseif $reaction == &quot;resist&quot;&gt;&gt;//I just got kissed by a boy, and it was ... nice.//&lt;&lt;elseif $reaction == &quot;refuse&quot;&gt;&gt;//Oh my God, I just got kissed by a boy. Me. And ... and it was really nice.//&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;It is, without a doubt, the weirdest school dance you&#39;ve ever been to.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Later, as you&#39;re about to go to bed, you&#39;re reflecting on everything that&#39;s happened to you in the last four years -- almost //five// years now. A strange woman sent you hurtling backward in time to your own past to live your life over again as a girl, &lt;&lt;if $reaction == &quot;accept&quot;&gt;&gt;and you promised your parents you would try.&lt;&lt;elseif $reaction == &quot;resist&quot;&gt;&gt;and you didn&#39;t have much choice but to try.&lt;&lt;elseif $reaction == &quot;refuse&quot;&gt;&gt;but you couldn&#39;t imagine how to begin thinking of yourself that way.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; Now you&#39;ve been on a date. In a dress. In front of everybody.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Something on your mind, pumpkin?&quot; your mom asks, seeing the thoughtful look on your face. &quot;I hope you had a good time.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Still thinking of the dance, you reply...&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;if $reaction == &quot;accept&quot;&gt;&gt;— &quot;[[It was so amazing.|Adams Junior High 8th][$resistance -= 15, $course to &quot;amazing&quot;]]&quot;
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\

&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You end up staying home the night of the spring dance, and it&#39;s not as much fun as you had hoped. Most of your girlfriends managed to get dates and you&#39;re the only one &lt;&lt;if $friends.includes(&quot;Jillian&quot;)&gt;&gt;-- you and Jillian Murphy -- &lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;stuck at home without anybody to talk to. None of the other girls is home. They&#39;re all out. Having fun. Without you.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You never imagined, five years ago when you were first sent backward in time, that you&#39;d feel so blue sitting home alone on the night of the school dance. You never thought this would be such a lonely place to be. But it is.&lt;/div&gt;

There is nothing more you can do except admit that you&#39;re a girl now.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;set $grade to &quot;8th&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Seventh grade ends, and eighth begins. Almost all of the other girls in your school are developing in earnest now, their bodies changing, becoming curvaceous and female like yours. You were an early bloomer, but now the rest of your female classmates are starting to be on an even footing with the boys.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;And the boys are starting to catch up, too.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Last year you felt pretty tall, or at least pretty average, among the kids in your class. Only a few boys were taller than you. Now the boys are starting to shoot up in height as well, filling out with more muscles and more facial hair. The smells in the hallway are stronger, and the perfumes and deodorants masking them much more pungent.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;set $boobs += $newboobs&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $newboobs to 0&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Your own body isn&#39;t done developing, either.

The waistband of your jeans and skirts are starting to pinch at the hips just a little -- either you&#39;re getting fat, or your butt is getting bigger. Either way, guys really taking notice. Also, your boobs &lt;&lt;if $boobs == 5&gt;&gt;are still growing like crazy, shooting past C cups and into the D-cup range, and going strong. For a while your bras were so snug, you could see the effect of big breasts squashed around tight seams in each cup, right through your shirts and sweaters. &lt;&lt;if $path.includes(&quot;like small boobs&quot;) or $path.includes(&quot;boobs too big&quot;)&gt;&gt;Even worse, it feels like they&#39;re still not done growing.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;They&#39;re still not done growing, either -- you just know it.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;elseif $boobs == 4&gt;&gt;are still growing. Your B-cup bras are tight across the chest now and you have to move up to a C cup. &lt;&lt;if $path.includes(&quot;like small boobs&quot;) or $path.includes(&quot;boobs too big&quot;)&gt;&gt;Unfortunately, it feels like they&#39;re still not done growing.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;They&#39;re still done not growing, either -- you just know it.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;elseif $boobs == 3&gt;&gt;are still growing, at least a little. Now they&#39;re up to a solid B cup, and &lt;&lt;if $path.includes(&quot;like small boobs&quot;) or $path.includes(&quot;boobs too big&quot;)&gt;&gt;thankfully it doesn&#39;t look like they&#39;re ever going to get any bigger.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;they&#39;re probably not going to get any bigger.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Then eighth grade passes, too, and you&#39;re facing another big change. You&#39;re about to be in high school.&lt;/div&gt;
